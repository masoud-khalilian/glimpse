0829814000,Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,"Summary 1: I just finished the book, &quot;Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,&quot; by David Ray, an outstanding resource for small church pastors, as is his other book, &quot;The Big Small Church Book.&quot; I will be rereading both regularly and referring to them often. I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more.
Summary 2: Many small churches feel like they can not have great worship because they lack the resources that larger churches take for granted.Ray's list of ""thou shalts"" is worth the price of the book.The description of various ""personalities"" in the small church is both humorous, and so true.This book gives encouragement as well as practical advice.
Summary 3: I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!
Summary 4: I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the ""Thou Shalts"" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!"
0802841899,The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today,"Summary 1: With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled ""The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,"" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the ""rock"" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to ""the gates of Hades will not prevail"" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, ""The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,"" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, ""people of God,"" ""body of Christ,"" and ""community of the Spirit."" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, ""The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership."" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: ""Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God"" (pg. 170); ""Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord"" (pg. 180); and, ""Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness"" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do"" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, ""The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly"" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. ""The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry"" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, ""The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life."" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder.
Summary 2: Everett Ferguson approaches the subject of early christian development with quotes from their early documents in their own words. Ferguson gives us a peek into the minds of early Christians and puts it together in a form one can understand today. The only criticism is that he can get too technical and detailed at times. With patience his writing is able to be followed by a serious student of the subject of God's church. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of the subject!
Summary 3: This book is a continual resource. It is so biblical and so simple. Dr. Ferguson's candid honesty is transparent to the bright shining light of Christ's words for His glorious Church.
Summary 4: This is a very useful and thorough text book. I would recommend it for anyone who wants an in depth study of the Lord's church."
B000JINSBG,A Walk in the Woods: a Play in Two Acts,"Summary 1: This play was excellent. It's very smart, intellectually and morally meaty, and fast. I highly recommend it. Especially good material to ponder for people who in today's age can still think of the US or any country as being moral and right and good.
Summary 2: This is a fast read filled with unexpected humour and profound insights into the art of politics and policy. In brief, it is sly, wry, and wise.
Summary 3: This is an old play I saw on stage many years ago. It still brings a laugh at times. But also a reality check at other times. Truly a great play. Glad it's still available."
0792391810,Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science),"Summary 1: An essential book for researchers and engineers working on vector quantization. It provides a (nearly) exhaustive description of the available VQ methods, with analyses and discussions. The book concentrates on VQ, so don't buy it if you're not interested in that only. Most math tools explained. Could be a little bit outdated on some aspects -&gt; things are moving fast in the field.
Summary 2: This book appears to be a ""print on demand"" style book which manifests itself, in this case, as a poor quality hardcover. Some of the text is laughably bad, the few images near the end look like they are snapshots from a black and white TV screen, but most bothersome is the ""muddy"" look of the text. The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print. That said, the actual content is very comprehensive. One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm. Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing.
Summary 3: It seems somebody was complaining for the printing quality. This is not a calculus book. If you take most theoretical books, and certainly most Springer's book, they don't have nice full color Barney images. This is technical (mostly theoretical) stuff. There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field."
0195178548,The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford Handbooks),"Summary 1: Do you want to brought up to speed on the state of the art in philosophical discussions of free will? Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book.
Summary 2: So far forth, the editors of the Oxford Handbook series have managed to put together products which both the neophyte and the fully-informed scholar will find beneficial. Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended.
Summary 3: I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P. Erickson, M.D.christianerickson@alumni.duke.edu"
0517150328,History of Magic and the Occult,"Summary 1: Seligmann, an artist and a &quot;bibliophiliac&quot; of twentieth century, presents a noteworthy panorama on the roots of magic and ancient beliefs &amp; superstitions in this richly illustrated work. This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge. Seligmann provides us a classified history of magic, beginning with ancient Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan and Greece; then shifts the main route towards the medieaval Europe. All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars. But in general, &quot;The History of Magic and Occult&quot; is a &quot;compact encyclopedia&quot;, you'd like to own.
Summary 2: Kurt Seligmann, Surrealist artist par excellence, admitted &amp; unashamed bibliophile, has ravaged his occult library in a miraculous marriage giving birth to this classic historical account of Magic and Occultism; entirely written for the proverbial 'man about the street', and a very cosmic avenue is here tread in an admireable chronological ordering of the various mystical houses. Addressing all the various occult(semantic definition of &quot;hidden &amp; rejected knowledge&quot;) routes via the shortcut of this Art Historian's scholarly mind, as a whole this work is one of the best and most easily approachable &quot;magic histories&quot; for those who have no previous knowledge concerning occultism except an undeniable interest and fascination with the mysterious and the spiritual.Kurt Seligmann is darkly fascinated and explores endlessly the multitude of historic beliefs concerning the study of the nature of evil... such as black magic, necromancy, Elizabethian era conjurers and their Enochian magic,primitive rites, evocations of the Cultus Satanus, Goetia Demonomania, et.al....as an example, early on he discusses Chaldean phliosophies in which: &quot;Evil was born from God's disturbing thoughts&quot;...I have long wondered if the proposed thoughts had to do specifically with humanity?...and this book will surely set the fire or fan the sulphurous flames of those burning to know more about all things occult.The book primarily deals with Western Esoteric Traditions, which, being a westerner, appeals to my insatiable explorative appetite in studying and discovering the divinity of humankind and the accorded propensity &amp; potentials of individual spiritual progress through Magick and the strengthening of divine will ; in comparison with more Eastern idealogies concerned with mystical enlightenment and the abolishing of the ego to attain Nirvana.In summation, Kurt Seligmann, as one of the last efforts of his exemplary artistic journey throughout the early 20th century avant-garde, has given the world a completely unbiased in-depth world history from a magical perspective, a genuine labor of love which will always retain its intimately artistic personality in contrast to the strict scholarly treatise of the newspaper skeptic variety; and although there are better, more developed and intrigueing accounts out there, none are at the moment so readily available and economic, nor so expressive, or conclusively compact as this. Finally, the book has over a hundred and fifty illustrations from alchemical treatise and magical grimoires which compliment his descriptive writing style.It is besides all this, another exclamation point puncuating the Surrealist movement. surrealyours, an occultist.
Summary 3: I have the older version of the book, but I understand that the content is generally unchanged.As someone who was desperately seeking some history without the New Age spin, this is a good resource. I'm almost tempted to say excellent resource, for what's there, tho he does focus on Western and Middle Eastern concepts.The main flaw I see with the book is the writing style. It's very 'academic', which I often find is synonomous with dry. I understand why the flashy New Age books sell - they capture the audience who doesn't go for the more scholarly approach... and I have difficult reading this book without my mind wandering.That said - it's not about flash, it's about substance... and it is a very interesting and informative piece of works.
Summary 4: Kurt Seligmann, Surrealist artist par excellence, admitted &amp; unashamed bibliophile, has ravaged his occult library in a miraculous marriage giving birth to this classic historical account of Magic and Occultism; entirely written for the proverbial 'man about the street', and a very cosmic avenue is here tread in an admireable chronological ordering of the various mystical houses.

Summary 5: I recommend this book for anyone beginning to study the occult. It will give you a strong base by which to begin your studies. It is a very dry read as most occult books are. You will regualrly return to it for references throughout your studies.
Summary 6: The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
1884734766,Dealing With Disappointment: Helping Kids Cope When Things Don't Go Their Way,"Summary 1: Written by Elizabeth Crary (a parent educator of 25 years' experience), Dealing With Disappointment: Helping Kids Cope When Things Don't Go Their Way offers parents, teachers, child care providers, and anyone else who works with children a straightforward guidance to teaching children how to meet and deal with seemingly insurmountable challenges. From learning to recognize when children are truly upset or shaken; to the dangers of trying to make or keep children happy at all times; to teaching young ones self-calming and problem-solving skills with step-by-step guides and games; to learning how to keep one's cool when the kids lose theirs, Dealing With Disappointment is an excellent and strongly recommended resource filled from cover to cover with positive and practical guidance and guidelines.
Summary 2: This is my favorite parenting (and lifeskills) book for learning how to identify, process, and master one's feelings. It is so practical and really applies to any age of child/adult and parenting style. The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says ""You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it"" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings ""You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum"" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book! You as the parent will also come away with new and better coping skills for yourself.
Summary 3: What a relief to read this book. As parents, it's so easy to assume it's our job to keep our kids happy. This workbook teaches step by step, how to help children talk about their feelings, calm themselves, and problem solve when things don't go their way. It even reminds us what we can to do stay calm when our kids are disappointed. There are so many possibilities and sales pitches in today's world that managing disappointment is essential. Fortunately, this book teaches how."
0781810698,Beginner's Yoruba (Hippocrene Beginner's Series),"Summary 1: This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.
Summary 2: While I am still in the process of learning the Yoruba language, I think that this book is a nice beginners tool. Please keep in mind that the new book comes with to audio CD's that are MUCH NEEDED! So if you're considering buying the book used, fine, but be sure to ask if the CD's come with.Without the audio assistance, I'm not sure how great of a tool this will be in your journey to learn the beautiful language of Yoruba!Best,S
Summary 3: This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as ""teacher"" but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first, they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book, which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher, though. All in all, it's a great set and, if mastered, can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator, who speaks English to announce the lessons, is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead!
Summary 4: I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills.
Summary 5: I recommend this book highly. I have a competitor's text also and while it is useful, I appreciate the format of Beginner's Yoruba which is interactive. The companion CDs that come with this book are simply outstanding. I especially enjoy the fact that the book is respectful of ALL religions.As an update after using the CDs for a few weeks, it is true that the speaker who speaks fastest on the CD does make many mistakes. I noted errors on greetings. These are rather odd to say the least. However, I still think this is a great source! My toddler is learning right along with me and she demands I play the CD everyday! As we repeat phrases, I simply correct the errors. I really appreciate the different participants on the CD and the dialogues which are authentic and properly contextualize the vocabulary.The phrase ""O'ngbiyanju"" is priceless!"
0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis","Summary 1: This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: ""Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)."" Or ""Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)."" Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover.
Summary 2: Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM ""a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis.""The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only ""treatment"" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on ""bad parenting."" No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually ""incompetent, lazy, or bad."" He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the ""adult orphanage.""Those of you who are interested in ""alternative psychiatry"" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf
Summary 3: This book should be required reading by all psychiatrists. There is still so much to learn from this maverick psychiatrist. Dr.Sydney Walker 111 was an unforgettable and unique and towering giant,we will not find another Dr.Sydney Walker again!! The closest thing to another Dr.Walker in Canada might be the ill-fated Dr.Ed Pakes,a brilliant pioneer bereavement psychiatrist. There is also Dr.Robin Brooks-Hill. Then there is an aloof South African &quot;Shrink&quot;,and his son,who wrote some book called &quot;Freud&quot;. (Obviously that isn't really the correct title,but it is a free country) Besides,why see Dr.Aloof Shrink when you can watch Meryl Streep films on Video. Bouchard is no longer a power,Richler is dead,Where is Trudeau or Lon Chaney Jr when we need him?"
B000PHTCGG,Seance,"Summary 1: Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, ""The Seance"" and ""The Letter Writer"" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form.
Summary 2: Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!
Summary 3: &#34;The Seance&#34; is a collection of short stories. It portrays the lives of Jewish characters in Eastern Europe between the wars.I found the book a little hard to read. Singer paints his characters so clearly, you can actually smell them. That is sometimes too hard to take. I saw my grandmother in his pictures and it wasn't to pleasant.
Summary 4: THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of ""Yanda"" is a provincial prostitute, while ""Zeitl and Rickel"" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a ""take a book, leave a book"" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable."

I've found over 100 sources of funding that I qualify for right now and about 50 more that I qualify for later. I am really loving this book. It is designed in such a way that it's easy to scan all listings for ones that apply to you and easy to search for specific ones as well. In the back everything is indexed several ways, making things even easier to find.The information they provide you with is comprehensive and extensive. Kudos to the editor and researcher!If you're a writer, be it fiction, plays, journalistic, non-fiction, whatever, this book is a great resource for you.
Summary 2: A bit outdated but full of very useful information, including writing contests, govt grants, overseas residencies, writers colonies and a few other programs.I found 6-12 very good items in this book and there were a choice of about 300 (i.e. about half are for magazine contests).
Summary 3: Dear Sirs: I'd like to make my brief sketch of my past career. Whe I was little,I used to make some performances even in my class at a elementary school,such as comical actions,reading a poem with the too-exagerated and help make attractiveness from other cute/smart girl classmates,althoug seemingly,I have only few memories for me to study homeworks after school,but I had stood top groups about the results of regular tests. I feel, I had turned my focuss upon studying when entering a top ranked high-school in Osaka,Japan, the excellent school;each classmates used to be a very brainy/smart with the background before, had a brilliant school histories. Those days,IQ TEST(mental ability test) had been available,and as far as my memory serves, in a few times,informed me of my scores from the teacher, I do not all of them,but a IQ Score of mine was 154 or such,just still in my memory.

1890951617,Academic Freedom after September 11,"Summary 1: Jill Malter gives a terrible review to any book that dares to say, even in the most timid way, that the Palestinians might have the teeniest bit of a point. The pattern suggests that this is her automatic reaction to any book that does not agree with her prejudices. So please disregard her reviews; they are biased in the extreme.
Summary 2: I surft on this book out of mild curiosity. But reviews like the three posted here convince me that the book must be well worth reading. So I'm buying it. Thanks, team! (I apologize for the 5 stars, since I haven't read it yet. But the program wouldn't let me post this comment without a rating. I'll get back to y'all when I'm finisht reading the book.)
Summary 3: While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat.
Summary 4: Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme.
Summary 5: Most of the authors of this book say, in effect, that they are accused of being anti-American. By right-wing fanatics! But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that ""pro-Israel lobbying groups"" and others are ""policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse."" Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers ""effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism."" That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's ""extracurricular"" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was ""disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."" But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that ""any criticism of Israel"" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote ""violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."" Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs ""the American Likud."" He says ""this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."" And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is ""false and brazenly bigoted."" It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards."
1597400602,America at 1750: A Social Portrait,"Summary 1: This is a magnificent work of historical imagination. Hofstadter's last book, it was what was to begin a much larger, possibly three volume epic on the social conditions of America at distinctive periods in our history. And while this book is missing the fuller vision of a more articulated society, the chapters that are present are truly alive with insight and understanding of the way things probably were. Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can't help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing).
Summary 2: I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece.
Summary 3: One of History's saddest events, I mean in the discipline of History, was the premature death of Richard Hofstader.With this book, the last he wrote, not finishing it, he also was making a turn in his writing career. Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was ""God,"" now it is sometimes ""God"" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self.
Summary 4: AMERICA AT 1750: A Social Portrait, by Richard Hofstadter. 293 pages. Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: ""Anti-intellectualism in American Life"": ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays""; ""Social Darwinism in American Thought""; ""The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States.""When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as ""America at 1750"" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in ""The Middle Class World.""One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren't even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start.
Summary 5: To give you a little insight on my opinion, I was assigned to do an ""outside reading"" for my U.S. History class and I picked this out of the list of acceptable books. This book really does pack a lot of information into it for you, and it breaks up the monotony of facts and locations by throwing in little stories, examples, and quotes, which give history a little more ""personal"" feeling. The first chapter is a real snoozer, dealing mostly in population figures and growth, but it picks up from there. I also found the last few chapters on religion and the Great Awakening a little redundant, but still interesting."
0812521765,Death Dream,"Summary 1: Book 2 of the Night Warriors saga and a must read!This book is about a kid that, when he falls asleep, unleashes a great monstrosity on the world. Only a group of selected individuals, who put their lives on the line, can try and save the day. When they battle, they have to battle in the world of...dreams!Graham Masterton, a true master of horror, is one of the best horror writers out there. You will not be disappointed!
Summary 2: Death Dream is the second in the Night Warriors series of books. It is not as good as the first novel, and also uses a different group of Warriors.A boy harbours a demon, who ends up killing a couple of people. The police get involved, and quickly realise that they need help, and this is where these Night Warriors get involved in the case.
Summary 3: This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!
Summary 4: A young boy becomes the portal for a ferocious Dreambeast and the Dream Warriors show up to do battle, but first they need to find help. Second book in the Dream Warrior series is a tad familiar, but still enough fun to recommend to Masterton's fans."
0689817630,Sleeping Boy,"Summary 1: This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children.
Summary 2: Note: This book may be too frightening for certain children. However, I think most children will be fine.This is an excellent picture book, set in Berlin from a time slightly before WWII to the time that the Berlin Wall fell.
Summary 3: Every once in awhile, amazing, complex and believable characters are born - Annie Shannon is one of those characters. Most women can relate to her on some level. A real woman with regrets, who doesn't have to be beautiful, rich or famous to be a central character in a book. I hope she will be a recurring character and that this wonderful new author will bring her back into our lives again and again.Stewart tells a gripping tale that hooked me from the first page to the very last. You get to know Stewart's characters so well that you visualize them clearly without having to be told what they're wearing that day or how they style their hair. She captures the essence of their personalities and makes them so believable that the reader buys into their motivations within the unfolding plot. The plot that unfolds is full of twists and turns keeping the reader guessing to the very last page. A remarkable accomplishment!!I highly recommend this new book - a compelling read. I hope we'll see much more from Barbara J. Stewart.
Summary 4: Many people may disagree with me, but I think this book is not suitable for children. The images are taunting and very nicely rendered, however, there are some strong hidden meanings within them. Such as the imagery of soldier and violent, and especially the general's black leather glove (maybe symbolic to the idea of totalism?).What interest me the most is the climax of the story; when the boy and his family falls into sleep, and they wake up when peace finally arrives to the country. I want to know why that symbolizes in the story, what is the author trying to describe or proof to the reader?I think this is a book quite dangerous for parents to read for their kids at bedtime, unless you go further in describing them the history and cross-meanings of the book--perhaps that is complete package of the book, and what the author want every parent or teacher to do."
1569474400,Behind the Moon,"Summary 1: This is the story of three friends and their families. This trio consists of ""multicultural rejects""; Justin ""Jay"" is the gay child of Chinese immigrants; Tien Ho, conceived out-of-wedlock during the Vietnamese War by a Vietnamese mother and African-American GI father; and Gibbo, a chubby, white, socially inept Australian who yearns to be Asain. Each character feels out of place in society and clings to each other only to find that they are even out of place with each other.After drifting apart for a few years, their parents take action to bring them together. They orchestrate a dinner to celebrate the life of Princess Diana and watch the live coverage of her funeral. During the course of the dinner, Justin is outed, Tien's fiance is knocked unconscious, everyone is ashamed when it occurs to them that they forgot Gibbo's birthday. And to top it off, the food is awful!Despite this disastrous dinner, it sets a series of events in motion to reconcile not only the three friends, but the families. In the worst of times, Justin's in a coma, Tien is getting divorced, and Gibbo is accused of being a stalker, they all come together to support each other.This book is captivating from the start and is wonderfully written. The author takes you on a journey with each character, bringing depth and perspective to the series of events. I came away from this book having learned something about people, life and relationships. For instance:Tien's mother, Lihn, in love with a black American solider, is rejected by her family for her love. In a letter to her father, she quotes a Vietnamese author I'd never heard of before, Nguyen Du:""It blows one day & rains the nextHow often does chance favor us in the Spring?If you ignore and scorn my desperate loveyou'll hurt me- yet what will it profit you?""The Tale of KieuThis passage struck me as relevant to my own life as many of my friends are in the stage of life where they are deciding who to spend the rest of their lives with. Not everyone is making good choices, in my opinion, and it's always difficult to know when you should speak up to prevent disaster and when to let people make their own mistakes. There were other passages and messages in this book that were thought provoking and had me reflecting on my life.As good of a book as this was, I still have to give it an overall rating of a 4-stars because of the ending. It was a little too....... happily ever after, for my taste.
Summary 2: Hsu-Ming Teo's novel was published in Australia in 2005 and released in the US this year. It is basically a story about three friends with multi-cultural backgrounds. Justin Cheong is a Chinese-Australian who is the picture-perfect son. His world becomes increasingly unstable as he comes to terms with his attraction to other men. Tien is the child of a Vietnamese woman and an African-American soldier. Living with her aunt and uncle in Australia, she straddles worlds of identity between Asian culture, Australian culture and wondering about her American father. Gibbo is a Caucasian Australian whose culture serves as a foil to the Asian. Overweight, Gibbo lacks confidence. He bonds with Justin & Tien as outcasts.Teo sets up the classic ""No Exit"" triangle where Justin loves Gibbo, Gibbo loves Tien, and Tien loves Justin. After the elementary to high school years, the friends draw apart. Justin goes camping with Gibbo with unfortunate results. Tien goes to prom with Gibbo with unfortunate results. The novel reunites them toward the end of college @ the Dead Diana Dinner (DDD) where relatives gather to morn the loss of the British princess and watch her funeral on TV. Here, the parents begin to take center stage and we go through their history. Gibbo's mom has been like a mother to Tien, but backs off when Tien's mother Linh finally arrives in Australia from Vietnam, via a Malaysian refugee camp. Gibbo's dad is a brusque medical doctor who gets upset with Justin's dad Tek and spills the beans about Justin's sexual orientation. Meanwhile, everyone has forgotten that this is also the meek Gibbo's 21st birthday. Tien plans to announce her engagement to Stanley, but Gibbo's mom knocks him out thinking she's caught an intruder.From the DDD, the novels spends several chapter in flashback as we learn all about Linh's history and her love affair with American GI Bucky. We also flash forward to see Tien in San Francisco with her husband Stanley and follow them through his modern art phase and Tien's flirtation with a new age feminist group that enjoys giving themselves haircuts in private places. Justin's life resembles that country song, ""Looking for love in all the wrong places."" Meanwhile, Gibbo develops an unwelcome attachment to Linh.This episodic novel sounds a bit melodramatic, but reads well. The characters are distinct and interesting, although none are perfect. Teo tries wax philosophical about the weaving of relationships into a lifetime pattern. For me, the Asian cultural self-analysis was interesting as people from various cultural backgrounds try to establish their own roots. Enjoy!
Summary 3: Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."
0976142120,Jimmy Jam Germ And the Happy Handshake (The Adventures of Thumbs Up Johnnie),"Summary 1: This is a humorous and delightful lesson in hygiene (not at all like what I encountered as a kid) and is fun, ""to boot""! I have to hand it to Michelle Bain, my daughter adores this and....wonder of wonders......asks more often to wash her hands.
Summary 2: I had heard about this book from a friend of mine who lives in Missouri, who is a school nurse. My children's school contacted the author and she came to our school with mascots and party favors for the kids. After reading her book Johnnie Finds A Buddy, she read this book to the kids and they went wild. She taught them the ""CLEAN HAND JIVE""- her song about washing your hands. At their school they teach the importance of washing your hands and even have a unit in science and their health classes about this topic. Most of the children do not find the topic of hand hygeine very interesting. To see the reaction of the kids after Michelle Bain read the book to the children my kids school we were pleasantly suprised. Finally, an author came up with a ""spin"" on hand hygeine that was funny and impactful at the same time. I hope that this writer tackles many of these subjects in the future!
Summary 3: My son loves this book--he is still too young to understand the concept of germs but loves the characters. Their names are catchy and easy for young ones to remember. He requests this book daily and still has not tired of it."
0060539453,"Bye-Bye, Mom and Dad","Summary 1: I am in love with the Little Critter books and so is my 3 year old son. This one in particular my son loved from the first page. He wanted to make his own peanut butter sandwich after reading it and I let him! He was so proud, just like Little Critter was with his PB and pickle sandwich. Great book.
Summary 2: I grew up with the Litter Critter books and they always have been some of my favorite children's books. I recently got this one for my son, and I don't care for this story much at all.First off, its about mom and dad going away on a trip. However they only address that issue once, and that's on the first page when mom and dad leave and it says that grandma and grandpa are watching them. They wave goodbye.Then all the rest of it is just Little Critter messing things up or having suggestions that aren't great (such as sucking up the curtain vacuuming, knocking over a vase dusting, spilling the paint, using too much toothpaste or dish soap, wanting to buy all junk food at the store, etc.)It really feels like this is so similliar or much more suited to the Little Critter I Just Forgot book or Little Critter Visiting Grandma and Grandpa. It has very little to do with getting your child ready to be away from mom and dad should they be going on a short trip so the book fails in what it appears to be trying to do based on the title. Most other Little Critter books do a great job of telling a story that covers some kind of kid issue or fear, this one just doesn't address the issue of the title and is dissapointing.
Summary 3: We love all the little critter books. They are always so colorful and fun to read. We also add a little more fun by trying to find the frog, spider and mouse on each page. In some of the books there is just the spider, in some it is just the mouse, and in others it is both. Sometimes there is a frog and a grasshopper too. They are hidden a lot of the time and it is fun to try to search them out.
Summary 4: My kids love the little critter books, and this is no exception. Great for my 3 year old, and even my 7 year old isnt bored too much by it. He enjoys reading it to his little brother at bedtime.
Summary 5: My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it."
0941668061,The Bar Code Implementation Guide: Using Bar Codes in Distribution,"Summary 1: &quot;The Bar Code Implementation Guide&quot; by Stephen L. Pearce and Rick Bushnell truly is a guide that will benefit anyone who already uses or is interested in using bar coding for warehouse and distribution systems. Written by two well-respected members of the distribution industry, the guide provides practical, easy-to-understand steps to implementing bar coding technology. This is not the average &quot;turn the page and continue reading&quot; book. The guide is divided into several sections that address the many facets of bar coding implementation in a clear and concise fashion. Want to know how bar coding can help your business? Turn to the &quot;Benefiting from Bar Codes&quot; section. How about the money aspect? Turn to &quot;Equipment &amp; System Costs.&quot; The guide also includes question-and-answer sections and numerous worksheet-style appendices. These are helpful for defining specific problems your business might have and offering solutions to these problems. This is especially useful for saving money. For instance, a handy Q &amp; A chart provides a way to quantify the dollar amount saved by implementing bar code technology. Above all, this guide is practical. From the description of how bar coding works to the breakdown of industry-wide standards, the authors have provided a wealth of easy-to-read information. The clarity of the information makes the guide useful across many business disciplines and provides a common language for trade partners. Follow the guide's plan and save your company money!
Summary 2: This is a superb reference guide for those who are looking to implement a bar coding system. It includes a number of practical tools which are quite useful.Be sure to order only the newest edition which was issued mid-2010. So ordering a used copy may not be the current one with all the updates.
Summary 3: This is a great book for anybody who wants to understand what bar codes are, how they work, how to prepare a cost/benefit analysis and how to implement bar codes. Even if it is called Using Bar Codes in Distribution, it is as relevant for other applications.There are a some redundancies in this book that would need to be fixed in a reeddition. Also it would be nice if a reedition was done since it dates from 2000 and technology has evolved so much. But still, even without these improvements it is a great book."
B000O2E8PC,Principles of Biblical Interpretation (Sacred Hermeneutics),"Summary 1: I am a Seminary instructor teaching a course called Principles of Biblical Interpretation. Obviously this book is part of the required reading. It is a 'standard' work by which I mean that it and a few others are considered to be baseline, required reading for anyone who wishes to advance beyond the elementary level in the field of hermeneutics.That said, I give it four stars because it is definitely not accessible by everyone. It is written for people who have a serious goal in mind and a disciplined study habit. It is not ""easy reading"" though it is well worth the effort. Further it is much more beneficial to those who have at least a working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew & Greek. In my class there are those who are entry level students (or auditors) who do not meet these criteria and I require them to read Berkhof but I augment the course with other books (""Reading the Bible With Heart & Mind"" by T. Longman, for one). This helps them advance with what they can get from Berkhof and reminds the more advanced students of their need to remain devotional in their Bible studies also.All in all, highly recommended for any reader as long as they understand what they are getting. You will be introduced to the various historical approaches to Biblical Interpretation (there are more than one you know), a sketch of a critique for each and a solid outline of how to build a more carefully crafted understanding of what the Bible teaches in your own reading.
Summary 2: I'm currently doing a course entitled ""Introduction to Biblical Interpretation"". This is one of the books I've read to help me come to terms with the material.This book appears to be based on a set of lecture notes prepared by Berhof for his students, more than having been written as a book from the beginning.I found its treatment of the various topics related to Biblical interpreation easy to follow, but covered in less depth than most other books. That said, I think what is said here would be sufficient for many people to come to terms with the core principles.At the end of many of the sections in the book are a list of references to other books and a set of questions. The questions seem to be based on the other works referenced, but I haven't been able to check as I don't have access to any of the cited works. Unfortunatly, due to the age of this text, many of the cited works are not longer in print.Many of the questions later on in the book are require you to apply the techniques covered to particular verses; no answers are provided, so it'd be useful for you to have someone who you can ask to check your answers.
Summary 3: This book is very helpful. It arrived in fine condition for a used book. A Good buy !"
B000890HE2,Gaston de Blondeville (The modern novelists),"Summary 1: Valancourt Books' recent publication of Mrs. Radcliffe's Gaston de Blondeville is a publication long overdue. The novel, originally published in 1826, three years after the mistress of the Gothic's death, was actually written by her in 1803, but then suppressed by her from publication. The general belief is that she disowned the novel, thinking it inferior to her other work; literary historians have also claimed that readers agreed and greeted its publication with little enthusiasm. The primary reason usually given for why it is inferior is that it is the only one of Radcliffe's Gothic novels where she chose to use a real ghost rather than explain what appeared to be supernatural occurrences. The general reader, and especially the student of Gothic and historical fiction, should be allowed to judge the matter for himself and now that Valancourt Books has republished Gaston de Blondeville, that decision can be made.Gaston de Blondeville, while admittedly not as full of chills and suspense as The Mysteries of Udolpho or The Italian, is a remarkable novel in Radcliffe's canon. It marks a noted departure from her earlier novels, and in many ways, it displays her growth and restraint as an author. Considering all her previous novels were published between the time she was twenty-five and thirty-three, a remarkably young age for someone to write three of the greatest Gothic novels of all time, as well as a couple inferior ones, it is not surprising that Radcliffe sought to move in a new direction in her work. Gaston de Blondeville was the beginning of her growth in that new direction, and had she written another like it, readers may have had a real treat in an even greater Radcliffe.My only criticism of Valancourt Books' edition of Gaston de Blondeville--which is filled with a superb collection of secondary sources and an impressive scholarly introduction by Frances Chiu to reflect the historical and political influences of the French Revolution upon the novel--is that no attempt is made in these supplementary materials to explain why Radcliffe made this departure from her past use of rational explanations for supposed supernatural occurrences. I believe that departure is the big question that must be answered about this novel, especially since Radcliffe was otherwise striving to be more realistic from a historical standpoint.Despite what is typically said about Gaston de Blondeville by literary historians, the six contemporary reviews provided in this edition are largely favorable. In her introduction, Frances Chiu quotes these reviews to argue that literary critics condemned the novel, but in truth, only one review is solidly negative while the rest express great enthusiasm for a new work by Mrs. Radcliffe. Chiu quotes La Belle Assemblee as saying ""it is without the lofty pretensions of some of Mrs. Radcliffe's earlier productions, and incapable of exciting an equal intenseness of interest"" but Chiu fails to quote what comes directly after: ""it will not in the slightest degree detract from the fame of her"" and ""it will be read with great satisfaction by every reader of taste."" Scots Magazine was pleased that the novel does not include so much of her poetry which is not remarkable at all, and overall feels the novel is an improvement on her earlier work because ""She avoided long particulars of rural scenery, and tedious trackings of the agitated mind, from one terrible or sorrowful imagination to another."" In fact, the only review that is truly negative is the Monthly Review, which does find parts of the work to praise but chiefly objects to its use of the supernatural.Why Radcliffe decided to include supernatural events as a reality has not been given a good explanation. Perhaps she felt the supernatural was more acceptable to the reading public by the earlier nineteenth century, nearly fifteen years after she wrote her first Gothic novel. While she may have been in competition with other Gothic writers, her contemporaries, such as Matthew Lewis in The Monk (1795) and William Godwin in St. Leon (1799), were not beyond using the supernatural as a possibility, so perhaps she need no longer provide rational explanations for supernatural events. Greater study is needed of how the view toward the supernatural changed and became acceptable in literature, especially during this period as the ""Age of Reason"" was replaced by the horrors of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.What I find more remarkable about Gaston de Blondeville than Radcliffe's use of the supernatural is that it is one of the earliest historical fiction novels. Sir Walter Scott is often credited with being the first major writer of historical fiction, but historical fiction certainly has its roots in Gothic novels with their typically medieval settings. The difference between Gothic and historical fiction is the concentration on a much more realistic historical world. The Gothic typically sets its novels in a more vaguely historical period or avoids attention to historic detail. A key component to historical fiction is the depiction of historical events and historical personages in the background of the novel, such as the Battle of Culloden as the background to Scott's Waverley (1814). If that is true, then I would argue that Radcliffe is our first true female historical novelist since Gaston de Blondeville, although not published until 1826, was written in 1803, a full six years before Jane Porter's The Scottish Chiefs (1809), that tremendous novel about Sir William Wallace, and only three years after Godwin's St. Leon (1799) which only really attains historical fiction status due to its including the historical character of Bethlem Gabor in its pages. (Arguments have been made that Clara Reeve is the first female writer of historical fiction, but I don't feel her work is historically detailed enough to merit such a claim). Radcliffe is far more historically detailed than Godwin in her descriptions of the court of Henry III and in the details she provides of that age of chivalry, tournaments, and medieval monasteries. While her novel may not have had the influence on historical fiction that Scott's works did, and therefore, she may not be the mother of historical fiction, not having led to the birth of similar historical works, as she was for Gothic novels, she certainly is the aunt, who has been kept like a skeleton in the closet, while Gaston de Blondeville has been treated as if it were better not to be talked about it, lest it ruin the Mistress of Gothic Literature's good name.I encourage all lovers of Gothic and historical fiction to read Gaston de Blondeville to make up their own minds. I personally find the novel a much more concise, controlled and mature work, and if not as fascinating and suspenseful as her previous works, one that deserves further attention. If Mrs. Radcliffe had written and published a couple more historical novels after Gaston de Blondeville, I have no doubt she would have rivaled Sir Walter Scott for his dominant place as a writer of historical fiction. As always, I commend Valancourt Books for preserving our literary heritage by printing such important and overlooked works of literature.- Tyler R. Tichelaar, Ph.D. in British Literature, author of Iron Pioneers, The Queen City, and Superior Heritage. For MQT REVIEWS www.MarquetteFiction.com
Summary 2: I am with the publisher, Valancourt Books, and wanted to post this description from the book's back cover, since Amazon has not done so:King Henry III is holding court at Kenilworth. Festivities abound, wine flows copiously, and spirits are high as the King and his subjects prepare to celebrate the nuptials of Sir Gaston de Blondeville. But the joyous mood is interrupted when a merchant, Hugh Woodreeve, comes distraught before the King to demand justice. His kinsman, he claims, was murdered, by the very man the King has come to honour -- Gaston de Blondeville!Suspecting a conspiracy against Gaston, yet obliged to hold a trial to determine the truth of the allegations, Henry imprisons Woodreeve in a tower while awaiting a hearing. Meanwhile, sinister forces are at work, represented by an evil abbot, who will stop at nothing to ensure the truth behind Woodreeve's claims is never revealed.As the trial unfolds and the danger mounts for both Woodreeve and Gaston, a mysterious figure will come from beyond the grave to elucidate the horrible mystery!The only one of Radcliffe's novels to feature a real ghost, Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This edition, the first-ever scholarly edition of the novel, features a new introduction by Frances Chiu, uncoding the novel's long-hidden political, historical, and religious contexts. A wealth of supplementary materials, including excerpts from other primary texts and the complete text of contemporary reviews, is also provided to enhance modern readers' understanding of the novel's themes.
Summary 3: A King is honoring a nobleman, yet an accuser comes forward and accuses the nobleman of murder. The accuser is put into jail. They plan to execute the accuser. The King has a supporter, a crooked abbot, who plots against the accuser. A ghost of the murder victim appears here and there to somehow explain the injustice and that leads the accuser to be thought to be involved in sorcery. That is the book in a nut shell! A Medieval Murder Trial. Not the usual Ann Radcliffe but the book is interesting and I recommend it!"
0836204271,Close to Home Revisited,"Summary 1: I loved this ! I bought 2 copies.. The first (new) for my girlfriends mother and a second copy (used) for myself. This is Clean family centric humor that is timeless. I spent the better part of 4 hours reading this and laughing like a loon in a coffee shop. The odd looks made it even funnier!
Summary 2: Cartoons featuring bizarre situations with a hint of truth can be either sick; funny or both. The cartoons in this book can be placed in one of these three categories. Life is always a bit bizarre, even when it is at its' most normal and routine. Somehow, each day manages to present a situation that is slightly odd, even though sometimes it is a strain to see it that way.McPherson has the perfect mentality and outlook to develop cartoons like this and he does see it that way. They are often exaggerations of the natural foibles of all aspects of life, from elementary school to retirement. There is the teacher that wants all students to contribute, so she ties ropes to their hands so that she can forcibly raise them. There is the barber who never sweeps up the hair because it insulates the floor.If you enjoy a sideways and bizarre look at life and what it presents, then you will enjoy this book.
Summary 3: I was a little disappointed with this. Though I enjoyed John's humour as always, there is a decided lack of coloured art. I remember purchasing a ""Bloom County"" book of cartoons back in the 1980's - and large portions of the book were in colour. But the reverse is true here. There are some illuminated sketches, but the great majority of the book is black and white. Half the fun of Mr. McPherson's work is witnessing the funny pictures, and the lack of colour interfers with this. I would like publishers, as part of the book description, to include an accounting of the amount or percentage of hued work.
Summary 4: This book is the BEST!!!! It's so funny when I first read it, I felt like I was going to COMPLETELY LAUGH MY HEAD OFF!! Some examples of the cartoons that are in this book are- a necklace that is made out of baby teeth, a woman who blows her face off with a hair drier, and a man who juggles at the dinner table with meatballs! So see what I mean? This book is TOTALLY HILLARIOUS!! So buy this book- NOW!"
0070434425,Study Guide for Use With Financial Accounting,"Summary 1: When I first took Financial Accounting, I was using Prentice Hall's Accounting textbook by Hongren. My prof was real anal-retentive and required us to read every chapter. To ensure this, he would quiz us on the contents of each chapter before we covered it in class. I spent so much time trying to wade through the excessive verbage in that book that I ended up not having any time left to do actual problems or sharpen up my practical skills. As a result, I ended up with a D in the class although I understood most of the concepts very well. When I took the course again over the summer, I had a different professor and he used this book. What a breath of fresh air! Meigs and company explain the accounting concepts just as thoroughly as Hongren but with about half the verbage. I breezed through my summer course and got the highest grade in the class. This book is an excellent teaching tool for beginners and would also make a great reference guide for more advanced students.
Summary 2: This college accounting book is SO UNDERSTANDABLE--it uses PLAIN ENGLISH, doesn't give you a lot of hard to understand theoretical concepts like other accounting books. it gives you what you need to know in order to study accounting and in a format that you can understand. you can read thru 1 chapter easily since it only gives you what you NEED to know. it first gives objective questions in the front of the chapter and then summarizes the definitions for important words, phrases, and terminology at the end of each chapter. it's very practical in introducing you to real life accounting.SORRY--THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE TEXT BOOK, NOT THE STUDY GUIDE.
Summary 3: I think the study guide is more useful than the book. I find the book to be very dry and impossible to get through. The study guide in contrast narrows the focus and dispenses with the boring example sin the book. I only need the book for the quizzes in our class. I do all of the exercises in the study guide and have an A in the class.
Summary 4: I was going to get a book with a ISN number of 0072316373...But today, I got one with 0070412901...So I need you send my money beac to my account, and give me a well reason why you let the seller mail me a totally different book again, It is the second time I get an item with wrong number"
0441006450,Poltergeist: The Legacy 01: The Hidden Saint,"Summary 1: I was a little disappointed in this book! Overall it was okay, but here are a few items that I'd like to point out. Nick to my knowledge, drinks beer, eats hamburger, potato chips, etc. and works out. So why did he prefer low-fat bacon to regular bacon, that little item could have been left out. Also, the author made Derek and Rachel out to be wimps! Out of all the things that Rachel has seen and done, I find it hard to believe that she cried over some gory photos. And Derek, the author in my opinion made Derek very weak and emotional. He wasn't that emotional when his sister was kidnapped and used as a sacrafice. Alex was the only one who was even close to her TV character. Maybe his next novel will be better. I haven't given up on this yet! If you don't mind my making a suggestion, perhaps the authors should focus more on the personalities and reactions of the TV characters. As a P:TL fan, when I read this book, I would like to visualize the characters as if I were watching them on TV. I have watched this show for four seasons and these just weren't the characters that I have come to know.
Summary 2: For all of you Poltergeist: The Legacy fans out there, this book is a must have item. Mr. Hautala does a very fine job of carrying on the best traditions of the show by combining mystery, adventure, and edge-of-your seat intrigue and excitment in the 244 pages of his book. A heart felt thanks goes out to him as he leads off what will hopefully be a long line of successful authors for this series.
Summary 3: What a ridiculous book! I sensed no plot, the characters were weak at best, the story didn't flow evenly, and I got the feeling the author wrote it for something to do in his spare time. Most stories evoke feelings in the reader, this one evoked only boredom. The author never even explained who or what &quot;The Legacy&quot; was. From reading other reviews, I gathered there is a TV show, but the author should have opened his mind to those of us who are new to his series. Nothing concrete was explained, the evil Mr. Hunter even seemed vague. And after attempting to build Mr. Hunter into an ominous subject, he is melted with a dash of holy water. Puhlease.... Not once was it mentioned how Mr. Hunter planned to carry on what was his life's work and meaning after he slaughtered his comrades either. Don't waste your time on this ugly manifestation of literature, it speaks only to the weakest of minds. Evan's mother was a joke, what was that &quot;fog&quot; she supposedly carried around? And WHO, if not Evan, was speaking to her? If we got the TV show here in Saudi Arabia, I wouldn't even bother to watch it after reading this book."
B0008AGXVW,Tales from silver lands,"Summary 1: I first got this book when I was in the 4th grade. Thats right, the 4th grade. It is an excellent compilation of above average stories. Ancient tales like the &quot;Calabash Man&quot; and &quot;The Tale Of The Gentle Folk.&quot; These stories can be appreciated across the board by all ages. The fantastic wording creates vivid pictures in the mind, and slips a moral in while you're not looking. I struggle to describe my appreciation for this wonderful compilation of tales. It is still my favorite book, since the 4th grade, and I'm in college. So it just goes to prove my point.
Summary 2: Tales from Silver Lands by Charles J. Finger won the John Newbery Award in 1925. I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend.
Summary 3: i enjoy folk/fairytales in general, and this collection is esp. interesting as a comparison to the more well-known european ones (the magic dog is eerily similar to the famous french fairy tale donkeyskin). there are some great images and situations, and although more than a few sort of meander and fizzle out there were enough uniques ones to keep you reading to the end. not the best, but not the worst either.
Summary 4: This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I.
Summary 5: This is a wonderful collection of tales from South America, which won the Newbery Medal 1925. The stories are for all ages and written to intrigue the reader and whisk him or her to a far away land. Brave worriers, fair maidens, rich kings, evil witches, and ferocious giants are all a part of these tales. My only negative comment about this book is that towards the end it became somewhat repetitive. All the characters became somewhat similar and the plots (although diverse) had similar paths. However, this is a great book for children's bedtime stories, and a treat to the adult who reads it to them."
0263834956,Sheikh (Mills & Boon Historical),"Summary 1: As the author of this book, I would just like to say that it has been successfully published in the Uk and reached number 60 in the hot one hundred best sellers. It has also sold successfully in Australia, Greece, Italy, America, Japan, Sweden, and is now being published in Poland. In Japan it was so poular that although only published last year it is now being reissued.To Amazon!! Please remove the stars as I do not have the right to rate my own book. I had to put them in so that I could post this as you no longer give the author a right to reply - which I believe you should when bad reviewers slate an author's book.Linda Sole. I write as Anne Herries and Linda Sole.
Summary 2: I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book.
Summary 3: Plot summary: England, 1925; Chloe, a shy 22-year-old college graduate, is hired by an old scholar to go to Morocco & help him with his research. On the way to Africa, by ship, she meets a mysterious man, ""Philip Armand"" who will turn out to be an Arab sheikh, Pasha ibn Hassim (I think I have that right.) Of course, eventually, Pasha & Chloe have a romance; they even get married, but the marriage is troubled by Chloe's discovery that Pasha is seeking his father's murderer & will pay to have the man killed.First of all, I have to say that I'm not giving 2 stars because this book is horribly written. I have to give the author kudos because the thing does moves along, even though the characters are one-dimensional, and the first half of the book is good escapism. But once Chloe reaches Africa, the story and the plotting become SO stupid (you can see the author's wheels turning by this time) so it's like, by the end, WHY did I waste time reading this book? Even the love scenes aren't too hot, though they are fairly plentiful.And while I was reading this, something else kept bothering me; I always thought the name, Pasha, was actually a form of title in certain countries? (Unless you're a Russian named Pavel.)Oh, heck, anyway, don't bother! Go and rent Valentino's ""Son of the Sheik"" instead! Or read Diane Dunaway's ""Desert Hostage"" for a REALLY good sand; sun & Sheikh romance novel. It's out of print, but worth the find."
1931055009,Gorilla,"Summary 1: This is a fast moving well-written story. Great characters and surprise twists make this very enjoyable to read. A wonderful afternoon reading project.
Summary 2: Ten gold bananas, two thumbs up and hurrah for Gorilla! What a wonderful book. It was a pleasure to read! If you just want to get comfortable and enjoy a book-this is the one I would suggest.
Summary 3: The most unusual story of a young man facing life with a handicap. I felt like a cheerleader and prayed that he could overcome. I could hardly wait to reach the end of the book. Don't peek!"
0882800590,Inside Folsom Prison: Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi Program,"Summary 1: I am the editor of this book, and I'm sorry to see it out of print. It had a rather garish cover, but the heart of the book was one of compassion and deep caring.George Ellis spent countless hours working behind bars to bring this meditation technique to prison lifers. I helped George teach the program at San Quentin, and every Tuesday evening, deep within the bowels of San Quentin, we would sit with men who would be there for the rest of their lives, to meditate and bring them a little understanding about the world within themselves; to help them find a little peace.This book is a valuable history lesson about alternate rehabilitation techniques. At Folsom, the TM technique was taught to men who were to be released within 3 to 6 months. The rate of recidivism among these men was half of that of the general population.This book chronicles the teaching of the TM Technique behind bars at San Quentin, Folsom, the Redwood County Jail, and other institutions around the world. I highly recommend it as a text for criminologists, psychologists, and all incarcerated people.
Summary 2: I was the final editor of this book. I spent a week secreted at Lake Tahoe making the corrections. I thought the cover was rather garish, but this is a book with a lot of heart. George Ellis spent a lot of time helping people who, otherwise, would have had little hope.This book is an inspiration and should be put back into print.
Summary 3: George Ellis is the genuine article, whom I knew personally in the 1970's in Berkeley, California, and look forward to seeing again! Ellis is a real public resource with a depth of experience concerning Transcendental Meditation and its application in violence prevention and rehabilitation. He should be on numerous national talk shows. Invite him!"

She was struck by the fact that Einstein was considered dull as a student. She knew of him only as a brilliant mathematician. She is inspired by the story of a boy who appeared to be unsuccessful in grade school and yet who made a huge success of his later life by pursuing his passion. She loved the book.
Summary 2: This book was well reviewed and I was very disappointed. Even if it's written for poor readers, does it have to read like Dick and Jane? Children are young, not simple-minded. Give kids real literature or they won't keep reading, they'll plug in to the media.
Summary 3: This is a very nice children's biography of Albert Einstein. It provides a good portrait of the young man, Europe and what it might have been like to be him. Einstein was great at mathematics but poor in reading and writing. He suffered for it and almost wasn't allowed to go on to higher education because of it. Einstein worked hard and was able to enter a university in Switzerland then flee to the United States as Hitler took over many European countries. A good story for kids.
Summary 4: Very well written, and easy for a child to read and understand. Also quite inspirational."
1566913721,"Moon Handbooks: Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, Third Edition","Summary 1: I've been using Michael Buckley's Vietnam Handbook for two months now and have found it to be excellent. It's well organized with country introductions which told me almost everything I wanted to know. Michael's sidebars are intriguing and I especially appreciate the city walking tours which have led me to many hidden little places I might have missed otherwise. The maps are better than those in the other guidebooks because sites are labeled right on the maps themselves rather than coded in a key which is impossible to read in dim lighting (a fault with the Lonely Planet series). Michael has provided not only the usual city and country maps, but also detailed inner city maps and even maps of the individual temples around Angkor Wat. This book covers three countries and sure beats having to buy and lug around individual guides to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. I've found that the coverage better than adequate and certainly head and shoulders above the general Southeast Asia guides which are surprisingly sketchy about these countries. Indochina is changing so fast that much of the practical information in any guide is bound to be out of date before the book reaches the shelves and this 1998 edition does require updating, but so do all the other guides to the region. You usually end up getting that kind of information from other travelers anyway. Of the three countries included, the coverage of Cambodia is the weakest, obviously because that country is only now opening to independent travel. Next edition Michael needs to get to places like Kampong Cham, etc. Meanwhile I recommend this handbook highly over all its competitors.
Summary 2: Adequate rather than good, this is no Lonely Planet guide. The structure covering three countries means a significant amount of flipping back and forth to locate information on the country you're currently in. The Siem Reap/Angkor Wat section is particularly confusing, with the practical (hotel, restaurant & general living) information interleaved with the descriptions of the temple complex.Although published in 2006, much of the political information did not appear to have been updated since approximately 2000.This book will not encourage me to buy Moon for any of my future travels
Summary 3: This is the best guide available. Moon travel beats the major competitor (the main travel-trail eye-sore creator) in almost all respects, but not all.Moreso than other travel guides, the Moon travel guide for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia has tons and tons of recent political, social and economic history in addition to significant cultural notes that a visitor *must* be aware of. (i.e., what does a South East Asian smile mean?) The maps of the cities and provinces are excellent. the all-important overland border-crossings between 'Nam, Laos, and Cambo are cleary marked. This is one of the many reasons that Moon can't be beaten at the moment. This guide's overland itineraries are the best. Example: you want to go into China overland fron northern Vietnam. How can you get up to Kunnming, China? It tells ya. And, we learn, that the one way flight into Bangkok from Kunming is the same price as the one that flys from Hanoi. (This price equality of course must be verified).The information regarding the pricing and existence of certain establishments that cater to travelers is outdated. However, where to eat or sleep has never been an important part of a book anyhow, just the general information about the area in general and how to get there is all a visitor needs. Does someone need to read a guidebook to decide specifically where to eat? Where to specifically sleep? If it does for you, do everyone a favor: stay home.The underlying story that provides the ""general-informational"" foundation is enough. When we come through town, understandably we don't know much, but that is far better than knowing absolutely nothing at all, which is quite common now from my conversations with tourists, and especially now among ""backpackers."" The purpose of why backpacking started has been lost for most.By the way, it is a fact that the communist government censors this guidebook. I found that out trying to pick it up at the post office. Well worth having.
Summary 4: I have just returned from a trip to both Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on the multitude of inaccuracies in this book, I would not recommend it. I bought the book because I wanted to try Moon Handbooks. Typically, I stick to Frommers or Lonely Planet.Of course, all travel handbooks are going to have their share of inaccuracies as prices change, businesses open/close, etc between the time of writing, its eventual publishing, and the buyer's trip to the country. In addition, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos are changing rapidly and thus frusterate any travel writer's ability to fully and accurately cover the countries.Having said that, this book's inaccuries and inadeqauate coverage clearly are below the expected standards of travel handbooks. At each location, I was continually frustered by the book's amateurish maps, poor recommendations, and shallow coverage. Worse was the author's discussion of the US involvement in Indonesia. In one area of the book, he states that the US bombing of Cambodia killed 50,000 and in another area the US bombing caused 100,000 deaths. Well, which is it? Kind of a big deal to get that right.One exception was the coverage of Anghor/Siem Reap. I felt the maps and the discussion were strong enough that I did not need a guide while going through the ruins.Overall, this book needs a complete revamping. It seems like the book was written in 2002 or 2003 with few updates for the 2006 edition. Again, not recommended."
0136159168,Practical Business Math: An Applications Approach,"Summary 1: I was afraid to order this but the book was great. What others paid hundreds of dollars for I got for much less. Thanks!
Summary 2: I avoided this class like the plague but I soon realized that once we got started my fears left me. The book was precise, insightful, certainly a book that can be used at a later date to refresh business math. I also give lots a credit to the Prof who taught the class and made it easy to understand the chapters on the book. I received an A (now I'm boasting!)..:-)
Summary 3: In our daily life we are so many times interacting with financial institutions. How they peolpe are counting our interest and fixing our monthly installments. How Payroll and Taxes. What is percentage and discounts. This all fundamental concepts of our daily life maths. This is the book which teach all this stuff. I re-memories all my school stuff and calculate all loans and undestand through this book. This book explain in very simple and sample way.Reading as students or as professional both good."
0441006469,Shackle and Sword,"Summary 1: I liked a lot of things about this book. I liked that the plot was not entirely predictable. I liked that the fey did not just immediately accept Farris when he encountered them. I liked that his reaction to being enslaved and brutalized was to get angry, rather than &quot;rising above it all and being extra-noble&quot;, the way that too many fantasy novel slaves do. I liked that characters in the book were complex, with very few of them being all good or all bad.What I did not like about the book was that the writing *was* predicatable. The plot was not very interesting or intricate, but with the strong characters, that might have been okay, if the writing were more intriguing. (I also thought that the author lost her courage when it came to the resolution between the main character and the man who sold him into slavery.) In this book, we have a moderately interesting plot, workmanlike writing, and very interesting characters. This book is worth reading if you have the time; it will not demand much from you as a reader, and it is enjoyable. It's also pretty forgettable.
Summary 2: This book just grabbed me. I think that the most important part of a book is how the characters are portrayed and I think that Alanna did a better job than most of the other authors I have read. Though the book was shorter than I would have wanted I read every word and didn't stop until the book was finished. I found her writing to be like Ann Marston and Lynn Flewelling, two of some of my favorite authors. I recommend this book to people who likes living in the world that they are reading about and feeling the that characters they are real.
Summary 3: Personaly this is one of my favorite books. It's one of those books you can read and re-read again and agiain, without getting sick of it. The way Farris is writtin and the way Alanna portrays him is awsome. Then the differennce you see from Farris-to-Bantam is wonderful. If you like reading books that don't hold back and make the characters seem above everything, but sound realistic but also adds magic in with that then, this is a book for you. This also isn't one of those constant blood-bath books or romance all the time books or the main ""character gets the girl everything turns out in the end"" books. It also doesn't have a tragic end were you begin to wish you'd never wasted your time on it. No when you finish reading this book you will NOT regret reading it. I've said to much. Oh, well. Read it and see for yourself if you agree with me!!!
Summary 4: The book had believable, likeable characters, a good story line, and an interesting ""world"". It was easy to visualize the setting and had very few ""interrupters"". (An ""interrupter"" is what I call it whenever something disruptive or out of place or incorrect abruptly throws me out of the story line and back into my own head. For example: a misused word such as using ""their"" for ""there"" or a misspelled word or a sentence that is grammatically incorrect, something in the story that doesn't work at all or contradicts earlier parts of the book, etc.) I enjoyed this book. A nice light read.
Summary 5: Good book, kind of corny (who am I kidding, it was real corny after the first half). I like it."
B0006DH586,"Dropout rates in the United States, 1990","Summary 1: One of the best books I have ever read. It has all the elements of a future classic. The characters are well written and as the story goes on you become one of the characters. Scanlan can make you cry with the characters as they go through growing up and becoming adults, as well as showing what real friendship and love is all about.
Summary 2: Another great read. You can really identify with the characters. Lots of ups and downs as in real life situations.I have read all of her books now and feel sad that I haven't another one to look forward to.I find she write in a nice easy manner and the connection between family members is so real. I would recommend this to any female looking for good story to curl up and read.
Summary 3: I really enjoyed this book it was certainly a page turner. I was sad to see it finish actually. This was my first time reading Patricia Scanlan and I have since ordered 2 more of her books. I enjoyed the characters and the determination of Cassie to see her dream through to the end.
Summary 4: Patricia Scanlan has written with great humour of a family fued built by jealousy, resenment and love. Emotions which abound in life, but are complex and difficult to solve. I enjoyed the ending (every dog should have its day!) although it was a little predictable."
0886770947,Days of Grass,"Summary 1: In this stand-alone novel, Lee explores an earth which has been decimated by invading aliens. The surviving humans are forced underground to live their lives the best that they can.Generations after they went to earth, a young girl named Esther defies what seem to her like useless laws forbidding them to go to the surface. When her tell-tale tan gives her away, she is taken to the leader of their community and her real adventure begins...The apocalypse is a convenient vehicle for one of the favorite Lee themes-- the value of the strong and contrary individual will. Esther is able to overcome all obstacles simply by believing in herself and refusing to accept false goals as an end state. While Esther herself is a very well-drawn character, the plotting suffers from its nearly exclusive focus on her stubborness. The aliens are sketchily plotted, nearly to the point of total invisibility. The ending is very poor and reads as though Lee ran out of steam.The book will probably appeal to the teenage reader (particularly the teenage girl?). However, parents should note that there are several reasonably graphic sex scenes, including some non-consensual sex. It should be fine for the older teenager, but should not be confused with a book suitable for a YA audience. If you have not read Lee before, I would recommend beginning with the Flat Earth series in place of this novel.
Summary 2: &quot;Days of Grass&quot; is a shorter novel, but it packs a real punch. The storyline is dark, with enough twists and turns to keep your eyes glued to the page. The first half of the book is excellent. I found Esther a very headstrong and original character, and I think Tanith does a perfect job of making her characters as different and strange as possible. Her writing style is fantastic.The second half of the book is a bit slower through the turns, as it is the darker half of the book. While the ending was most definetly shocking, I found it a bit of a dissapointment, because I felt more should have happened... yet I would most definetly recommend this book to any reader of Tanith Lee or other readers that prefer darker fantasies or sci-fi.
Summary 3: No spiritual experience like the Flat Earth, but I was won over by Esther's determination &amp; vulnerability. A reminder of our humanity."
158820863X,Musings of an Eccentric Dreamer: An Anthology of Love Poetry,"Summary 1: This is an interesting book that immediately caught my attention. From the first poem and throughout, each verse tells a story that seems to involve the reader at a very deep emotional level. There are some unique descriptions about the way a whole range of emotions are experienced through love. A different book, and good company on a quiet evening. Add it to your personal library.
Summary 2: LaChris Jordan's book, &quot;Musings of an Eccentric Dreamer&quot; is a book that describes life, love and happiness in its most descriptive moments. She touches the soul from a woman's perspective. I am glad to have writing that hits home.
Summary 3: This is a small book about big things, the things that matter most. Language and imagery combine to create the epic feel of a &quot;love story&quot;, one of cosmic proportions. Remarkably though it's the big picture ideas that do not lose intimacy. These are personal poems of a journey that has clearly seen suffering, but come through with a triumphant optimism that we could all use more of.
Summary 4: La'Chris Jordan's 'Musings of an Eccentric Dreamer' reflects the exploration of the author's inner self. The poems illustrate the author's metamorphosis to me. For the reader, the poems reveal an untutored voice with striking individuality. At stages it may seem naive, but it is that freshness which appeals more than anything. The collection of poems are about a wide range of emotions and events. It is a promise of more that will hopefully be fulfilled soon."
B0007IUTVU,Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel tidewater,"Summary 1: Do not, under any circumstances, listen to the previous reviewer (fuzcat) regarding this book. It is an excellent collection of fast reading short stories written for the person who loves the Outer Banks of N.C. If you have fallen under the spell of the OBX, get all of Whedbee's books. I guarantee you will be planning your next visit!
Summary 2: Charles Whedbee is a storyteller and this is reflected in his writing style. I found the style a bit abrupt and halting, but the most of the stories were interesting enough that I did not mind. ""Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel Tidewater"" tells the local tales of this North Carolina coastal area. The stories start as early as the first settlement, continue through until WWII and cover everything from Blackbeard and Hatteras Jack to the fate of Aaron Burr's only daughter.While I think I would much rather sit by a fire and listen to Mr. Whedbee tell his stories, I still think it was worth the time spent reading them. There are some wonderful little gems of North Carolina history hidden in these pages.
Summary 3: We bought the first of these books years ago when we were vacationing in the outer banks. They added mystery and magic to our vacations. Recently I read my favorite story to my grandchildren, who were there last year during Irene (we were evacuated). As children do, they weren't listening to me at first, then dropped their Gameboys and listened intently. We always read them when we go to the OBX. Now, my children are grown, and trying to take my books! Time for me to get them their own. I agree, if you love the outer banks, you'll love them even more when you read these books. Whedbee's love of North Carolina lore is catching."
B000Q9U9W4,Introduction To Mathematics for Life Scientists,"Summary 1: I purchaised this book while I was doing my Ph.D. I am happy that I now have a chance to write about it. Few books on mathematics are so enjoyable to read as this one. It explains concepts with amazing clarity. It guides you through all the necessary mathematics and will infact motivate you to take up mathematics as your major. This book should never go out of print. The author has made a long standing contribution by writing this book. There will be thousands of students who will be appreciate this book for generations. I would say buy it, with your eyes closed. You will never regret it.
Summary 2: I very much agree with the previous reviews. This book is a rare gem, a treasure, truly a work of art.It's the finest and most enjoyable mathematics book I've encountered to date, and that's taking into account the existence of many excellent math books. Certainly among books specifically on applied mathematics, this book is uniquely valuable.The choice of topics, sequence of presentation, level of detail, use of examples, and clarity and elegance of exposition are all outstanding. Batschelet has crafted every chapter, section, paragraph, and even sentence with meticulous care and precision in the finest Swiss tradition.If you've already studied mathematics through calculus, differential equations, probability, linear algebra, etc., this book is an especially good resource to review it all via a single coherent book.To illustrate how much I cherish this book, I've bought two copies -- one to read, and the other in case the first is damaged and the book goes out of print.If you love math, buy this book. If you just have an interest in math, buy this book and read it, and you may well come to love math.
Summary 3: I would totally recomend this book. Unlike other books that are intended to be helpful for life scientists, i consider this book really useful if you are, for exaple a biologist , not only because it includes many good biological examples but unlike other maths books, every chapter is very clearly explained. It cover almost all the topics youll need as a biologist so its perfect for reviewing and understanding dificult topics. It is also a great help if you are a teacher finding easier ways for explaining some topics o finding more suitable exmples. Finally i would says this boook is excellent even for highschool students. So buy this book you wont regret."
B0006DWYE6,"The ""Canary"" murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","Summary 1: Born in 1888, S.S. Van Dine (the pen name of Willard-Huntington Wright) was a noted critic who turned to writing detective fiction following a nervous collapse from overwork. His first novel, THE BENSON MURDER CASE, was a spectacular success, and throughout the 1920s he was considered among the finest writers of the mystery genre.Many regard his second novel, THE CANARY MURDER CASE, as his single best work. Concerning the murder of a popular New York star, the novel presents Van Dine's hero Philo Vance confronted with the ""locked-room"" murder mystery to end all locked-room murder mysteries--and discovering that each new fact makes the puzzle seem even more impossible than before. It would also prove among the most influential of his novels, broaching ideas that would later be elaborated by such notable mystery novelists as Agatha Christie.But time has not been kind to Van Dine's work. Van Dine wrote in a very wordy, almost academic style--something quite new and unexpected when CANARY was published in 1927. Unfortunately, once the shock of new wears off, his work reads as dry as dust, as serious and humorless as a scholarly disertation. It was an effect that readers and critics began to realize more fully with each new Van Dine novel, and even by the time of his death in 1939 Van Dine's work was regarded as more tedious than interesting.Van Dine is often compared to England's Dorothy Sayers, who also used a complex and highly literate style and whose detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, was even more artistocratic than Van Dine's Philo Vance. But Van Dine lacked Sayers' gift for making wild complexities, both in plot and language, entertaining--and he certainly never had the energy that Sayers brought to her work. In the end, THE CANARY MURDER CASE is an exceptionally uphill read, one that will interest only hardcore mystery fans who desire to trace the development of the genre. Three stars for historical significance.GFT, Amazon Reviewer
Summary 2: If you are a fan of murder mysteries, then you must read Van Dine, who was a pivotal figure in the development of that genre. Unfortunately, if you are a longtime fan, this particular story will seem rather feeble. You will guess the general form of the solution very early on. But, it is of its time. When it was written, both the plot and the writing style would have been fresh and original. Now, it is a period piece. It gives fascinating insights into American 1920s society, and shows where the early Ellery Queen came from.Recommended for serious fans of the genre, but don't expect a 'never would have guessed it' moment.[PeterReeve]
Summary 3: S.S. Van Dine's book was The Canary Murder Case was the second in what supposed to be a trilogy. This mystery centers around with the murders of a sexy nightclub singer known as the Canary and her boyfriend.. It was also originally made into a silent movie with Louise Brooks as the Canary, but then the ""talkies"" came into being and it had to be reshot using sound.This is another example of the early 20's - 30's mystery with its art deco atmosphere. Philo Vance is a upper crust maven of the arts with a hobby of helping the New York police solve mysteries. William Powell was also in the early movie, but it would be wonderful if the movie be could shown just to Louise Brooks as the Canary."
093259221X,The Klutz Book of Jacks,"Summary 1: A very easy to read book with many illustrations that covers some basic games with Jacks... onies, twoies etc. Easy enough for an 8 year old to read and follow, though not an exhaustive collection of games with Jacks. The included brightly colored cloth bag and lightweight multi colored metal jacks and ball made this a nice and complete gift.
Summary 2: I originally bought this book for the ""real"" metal jacks that were included.All I could find before was some gigantic plastic jacks.As I was teaching my grandkids how to play using the ""real"" jacks, I became addicted to playing jacks again!! What fun!Fellow Baby-boomers, listen up...is your eye-hand coordination faltering?? This is a great way to get some of that coordination back!Grandpa is going to teach the grandkids how to play marbles.I see some challenges in jacks and marbles on the playground (backyard)in the very near future! Now where is my favorite ""shooter""?
Summary 3: I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1583551050,Florida Birds: An Introduction to Familiar Species (State Nature Guides),"Summary 1: Nice pictures, but no descriptions and the map on the book doesn't even mention Merritt IslandBuy a proper birdbook rather than this overpriced pamphlet
Summary 2: Smaller then expected, thought it was a book but more like a pamphlet which actually makes it much easier to use quickly, great pictures and descriptions.
Summary 3: I love my nature guide to Florida birds. We have identified many birds using this invaluable tool. You can too!"
9996294544,Lucianos Luck (6 Cassette),"Summary 1: Carter is a former agent with ground knowledge in the hills of Sicily, where the Allied landing forces will need the cooperation of resistance fighters to avoid heavy losses to the occupying German forces. Carter has to recruit Luciano, a convict with Mafia ties, and Maria who has fled the mother country to escape the abuses of the underworld, represented by her grandfather, the key figure needed to coalesce the resistance fighters with the Allied cause.After I read a couple of mentions of Higgins in books on writing, I pulled this off the library shelf. Higgins knows how to get right into the action of a story and move the plot to adventure. He skillfully sets all the elements in place to give a dramatic story with action and conflict. The characters are a step above cardboard cut-outs, serving to propel events, and scenes are quick-cut, keeping the reading at a brisk pace. In all, it's a quick read that isn't entirely predictable.
Summary 2: A delightful change of pace as far as the main hero (Luciano) is concerned. Higgins does the WWII background well no matter what the story. (or plot) He manages to stick to his facts from other novel about the &quot;Mafia Connection&quot; and German forces. Though some of these facts are repetitive he manages to keep his readers on the edge with this change of pace (and hero).
Summary 3: A fast, interesting listen.General Eisenhower is willing to take advantage of any means to make the Allied invasion in Sicily a success. The Allied leaders want to gain the intervention of the Sicilian Mafia Godfather, Don Antonio Luca, to give the word to the Sicilian people to support the American and Allied efforts. To accomplish this British Professor/intelligence officer, Harry Carter, is sent to a New York prison to seek the help of Gangster, Mafia leader, Charles ""Lucky"" Luciano. Carter pulls Luciano from prison to meet with President Roosevelt who implies that Luciano's parole would go favorably if he helps his country in this matter.Luciano isn't inclined to believe the Don will be helpful but they pick up the Don's estranged Granddaughter, Maria, a Nun and a nurse, to help gain access and for an extra voice for convincing him. Carter, Luciano and Maria are teamed up with two American Rangers, one of whom clearly hates Luciano. They parachute into a small village in Sicily to join with resistance leaders who have to hide them from Nazi troops as they wait to meet with the Don.I thought the characters were well developed for the roles in the story. This story contains elements of intrigue, danger, arrogance, brutality, loneliness, a touch of romance, stubbornness, forgiveness, sacrifice and `luck.' I was surprised to learn this bit of history where the American President engages the services of the Mafia. I enjoyed the few meetings described between Carter and General Eisenhower and tried to jot down what may have been quotes but I did not find them so they may be part of the fiction. That is one draw back of audio books that you cannot mark a spot to check it later, especially when you are driving.This particular audio book was a production for Book of the Road and was made with a male and a female reader. The male did a good job with the different accents, British, American, German, Russian, Italian. The woman however sounded rather the same for the two important Italian female characters.You don't have to like war stories to enjoy this story. It involves a lot of personalities and some war strategy, good and bad, that makes it interesting. One thing that was clear in the story is that the actions of one person can have a great impact on how events play out.
Summary 4: Things you'd never learn without movies (or before that, thrillers) ...1. In Nazi thrillers, the professional honourable gentleman German officer usually have Prussian ancestry and has to deal with powerful rabid SS maniacs. If they come to blows, the SS always shoots first.2. Women who despaired of life and went into nunnery are always beautiful and unable to completely severe their ties to the mortal world.3. Tarot card readings are way more accurate than scientific projections.Sounds familiar? Perhaps with movie blockbusters today, all movie-goers would be familiar with the inexplanable facts of life but remember folks, you read it first in the books, one of those books being Higgin's Luciano's Luck.The unusual title is more unusual considering the central character of the story is not really Luciano, a big-time American mafia who was convicted on a bum rap. As the invasion of Sicily looms, the Allies desperately sought the compliance of the Mafia to reduce casualties and win over the Italian troops weary of Il Duce Mussolini. The most widely respected figure in Sicily was of course not the local governor nor the Italian generals nor the German commanders but the illusive Don Antonio, the capo of capos in Sicily. On his word, the whole island would rally behind the Allies, &quot;encouraging&quot; Italian troops to cease resistance and provide passage over inhospitable terrain from the landing beaches to Palermo.But Don Antonio disliked the Americans, just a little less than the Nazis. Only his estranged granddaughter, the Sister Maria, and the famous Sicilian American &quot;homeboy-made-good&quot; Luciano had any hope to gaining the ear of the Don.Harry Carter who slipped in and out of Sicily countless times found himself saddled with the two &quot;persuaders&quot;, dropping into enemy held territories, where not all Sicilians greeted their arrival with full enthusiasm.At the core of the matter, no one really knew how Don Antonio thought, and whether the mission was futile in the first place.Characterisation wise, there was a good range provided, from shepherds to soldiers to airmen. Higgins played out the full range of human emotions, from love to hate, jealousy to bitterness, pride and prejudices. It was a drama of humanity as much as gunfights and subterfuge.With additional work, Higgins could have made the book longer and even more interesting. But it was tricky, and the wrong move could kill the potential of a better book. Maybe he was right to quit while everything was still in place."
0791054616,Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat (Popular Cat Library),"Summary 1: Although books about particular cats/pets are rare and appreciated, I'm afraid this book gave me no further insight into my Burmese cat. Perhaps I am asking too much but I expected to find a plethora of special insights into this special breed. I didn't.Especially in modern cat care I felt this book lacking. My breeders says: Fresh meat three times a week; chicken wings (raw) at least twice for dental hygiene, vary the diet, enjoy the peculiarly dog like characteristics of the Burmese. But mabe that's all asking too much - gotta go, Nero is bringing his beloved yellow wash cloth for retrieval...It is hard to criticise a book that describes the best breed of cat on earth. Let's all write one!
Summary 2: I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing.
Summary 3: This book is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the history of Burmese cats. Useful basic information on care, feeding and breeding.
Summary 4: This book was very informative and filled with great pictures of the Burmese. I would highly recommend it to those who have recently acquired one of the cutest most playful cat breeds around."
0205314554,The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction (2nd Edition),"Summary 1: Logically enough Professor Herrick begins with an overview of his subject. He concludes with some of the better known modern rhetoricians. In between these two chapters he traces the history of the field and the various contributors. Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term. Herrick seeks to combine modern example with ancient methodology in some places. Generally speaking this book introduces the subject well. It is clear and comprehensive. I have used with favorable results as a textbook when I was teaching in Massachusetts.
Summary 2: If you have to get this book for a class and you want a less expensive alternative to the latest edition, this may be your answer. I am using this in my class right now and so far the differences are minimal.
Summary 3: Perfect for the history of rhetoric and where it all began starting with the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
Summary 4: I purchased this book for a class, rather than for enjoyment. That said, I found the book to be very informative and relatively easy to read. Of the two textbooks that I purchased, I most definitely prefer this one."
B000K0L2F2,The Birth of Britain volume One,"Summary 1: This is a very good book for the eariy history of Britain. Fantastic! It covers when the Roman Legions were in Britain & when the Normans came to stay. The most interestering part I thought was coverage of the civil war there & the crusades (King Richard the Lion Heart). The devastion of the Black Death, which killed millions in Britain & the rest of everywhere else. The war of the Roses was very interestering as well as devasting. The volume ends with the discovery & colonization of the New World. A Very good & fast paced history that helps the reader come to learn about & understand the early part of Britains history. A history that eventually led to the British Empire. A place where the sun never set on different parts of it. Great book. Loaded with information! Highly recommend.
Summary 2: This is a classic work of historical research. It is a must for any student of English history. It is concise and to the point. I especially enjoy the early centruies.
Summary 3: I was reluctant to begin this one for which I now feel foolish. In my mind, Churchill is so strongly associated with World War II, that though I know he was a historian, I imagined his historical prose would sound like the radio broadcast addresses he made to rally the nation of Britain during the war. I know, I'm really silly. This book is a masterpiece of narrative history. Churchill is comprehensive in his coverage, easy to read and generous with interesting details and connections.This volume is the first in Churchill's comprehensive History of the English Speaking People. This volume contains three books which cover Roman Britain, the age of the Anglo-Saxon Kings and Vikings and finally, the medieval kings of England. Churchill ends in the 15th century with the War of the Roses.Churchill's genius is in placing Britain and the English in the context of the broader theater of Europe while keeping the focus clearly on the lives of the leaders and common people who populated the British Isles.I'd like to note that this is hardcore history. Churchill covers a great deal of ground with names and dates and documentary references that might make it dense to readers not used to reading this style of writing. I've read far more stiff, less interesting and less detailed accounts of similar material, but that doesn't make this &#34;historical fiction like&#34; a la Alison Weir. Never the less, and particularly in the first book on Roman Britain, this is a readable work and well worth reading. To date, I have not read anything that explains and provides as clear a portrait of Roman Britain. Churchill's tales of war are also riveting. Edward I and III's French exploits as well as his tales of the Henry's gave me chills. Perhaps this is where the Churchill I expected comes through - though rather than a voice out of World War II, Churchill is truly a scholar speaking on the nation he loves in a voice for the ages. Good book!
Summary 4: For those unfamiliar with Churchill, do not dive into this book looking for a university reader in English history. Churchill is a masterful writer and storyteller, and he weaves a tale for over 500 pages of the rise of England - from the pre-Roman times to the rise of the Tudors. Covering nearly 2000 years in 500 pages is a tall order, but Churchill spends adequate time on the major stories of the period. The book reads more like a novel than a scholarly history and the characters can come alive. A nice background on early English history for the &#34;casual&#34; reader."
0312212240,Dirt Rich,"Summary 1: Sam Sheridan gets back from the trenches of WW1 and marries his hormone driven girlfriend, Georgia. An attorney's letter from Dane, Texas informs him that he has been bequeathed a 100 acre plot by an unknown benefactor. They travel to the town and meet with a wave of hostility. With a motley group of outcasts and, against all odds and expert opinion, they drill for oil. The book unfolds Sam's link to this mean little town and as they edge closer to striking the oil they uncover the sins and secrets of his legacy. Wealth beyond their dreams has its payback and into their lives steps a half-breed Cherokee who will ignite uncontrollable passions and cause upheavals that will go on to change their world and lives forever. (""The Wardens"" by this same author is also highly recommended)
Summary 2: A friend recommended this as ""THE best book he has ever read!"" I don't share that high opinion, but did find it an enjoyable read. Good characters, engaging story line with a couple of surprising twists along the way. Reminded me a little of the movie ""Giant."" Some people might be put off by the explicit sexual descriptions, but they were not numerous and had a purpose in the story.
Summary 3: I read this book in 1 sitting. I made the mistake and let a friend borrow it. She moved and took it with her. That was over 10 years ago and I still hold a grudge! I am dying to find a copy!"
0486406679,103 Great Poems: A Dual-Language Book (Dover Dual Language German) (German and English Edition),"Summary 1: Perfect for anyone who wants to read Goethe's peotry in German and understand it as well. For those familar with the German language, Goethe isn't the easiest writer to understand in German.
Summary 2: The poems, of course, are beautiful. The translations are often interspersed with the German poems, often of a different poem that was being translated.
Summary 3: I bought this book to help me learn German but I realized that I wasn't a huge fan of poetry. Goethe has a great writing style but I, being a philistine, could not appreciate his works. The english and german translations were placed conveniently next to each other for easy translation. I would recommend this book to someone who actually enjoys poetry."
0735104328,Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy,"Summary 1: In the year 1600, at the tender age of nine, Benedetta Carlini was sent to a nunnery in the small city of Pescia in north-central Italy. What today might be considered cruel and highly unusual was then a way for Benedetta's somewhat well-to-do parents to provide their daughter with protection. After several years at the nunnery which Brown describes as fairly unremarkable, Benedetta began to have a series of increasingly disturbing visions, including being sexually harassed by demons. Sister Benedetta was eventually assigned a companion named Bartolomea Crivelli (also a sister in the convent) whose presence, as the subtitle hints at, would later become problematic for her. Bartolomea's job was to assist Benedetta through her ""periods of ecstasy,"" and was present when she supposedly received the stigmata and exchanged mystical hearts with Christ.Naturally, this caught the attention of a Counter-Reformation Catholic Church whose main goal was maintaining a sense of propriety. Two separate people (men, naturally) were set out to Pescia to investigate what was happening. Stefano Cecchi was the first to investigate Benedetta over a number of visits throughout late 1619. Cecchi's main purpose was to ensure that she was remaining within theologically accepted boundaries, which she was extremely conscious of doing, knowing that moving outside of them would have put her reputation, and more importantly her life, in danger. Cecchi, satisfied that Benedetta was not a heretic, left quietly to resume his position as the provost of Pescia. At least for a while, things appeared to return to normal inside the convent.At some time between August 1622 and March 1623, the papal nuncio sent several representatives, led by Alfonso Giglioli, to examine Benedetta's claims again. In 1620, she had become an abbess at the incredibly young age of thirty, but had been deeply troubled by the recent death of her father. The nuncio's representatives proceeded much in the same way as in the earlier set of visits. Their final ruling on Benedetta's case isn't even given until the beginning of the epilogue:""The story of Benedetta Carlini is shrouded in mystery for the next forty years. No records exist of the nuncio's pronouncements, and it is only the chance survival of one fragment of one nun's diary that allows us to know the outcome. On August 7, 1661, that nun, whose name has not come down to us, wrote in her diary: `Benedetta Carlini died at age 71 of fever and colic pains after eighteen days of illness. She died in penitence, having spent thirty-five years in prison'"" (p. 132).At this point, you might be wondering, ""And the lesbianism? What about the lesbianism?"" Its relevance and Brown's discussion of it are extraordinarily fleeting. Bartolomea gave testimony that Benedetta sexually molested her and engaged in frottage with her while possessed by the spirit of a male demon known as Splenditello. While Benedetta and Bartolomea's sexual behavior merits perhaps a few sentences in the book, in the Introduction and peppered throughout the text, Brown discusses how Benedetta used Splenditello's ""maleness"" as a foil to explain away her rape of Bartolomea (and according to Bartolomea's testimony, that's exactly what it was). The book remains ambiguous as to whether Benedetta deliberately used her male demon as an excuse, or whether she actually thought he possessed her, but the nuncio's representatives seem unconvinced as they accuse her of ""pretending"" to be a mystic, and being a ""woman of ill repute.""One wonders what Brown's motivation was in giving the book such a gratuitous title. The content of the book, a scholarly interpretation of a set of documents couched deep in the State Archive of Florence entitled ""Papers relating to a trial against Sister Benedetta Carlini of Vellano, abbess of the Theatine nuns of Pescia, who pretended to be a mystic, but who was discovered to be a woman of ill repute,"" isn't really commensurate with the sensationalism of the title. The book provides an intelligent analysis of a lot of topics, from early seventeenth-century life to cultural assumptions of sex and gender. I almost wished the publishers would have chosen one of those horribly academic titles to give a better impression of what it was all about. I vote for ""Transgressing Normative Gender Identities Through Self-Conscious Afflatus in Renaissance Italy."" But then someone's going to pick it up thinking that ""afflatus"" means something dirty. Sometimes you just can't win.
Summary 2: This book is a fabulous depiction of the Italian nun, Benedetta Carlini, whose drive for ambition in the Catholic church drove her to get the help of her lesbian lover to create the illusion of stigmata. Through this, she moves to new heights of power and respect in the church and brings money and fortune to the church...but upon accusations and scrutiny, she's brought down to pay for her ambition. The story is a tenderly told one. It has feminist elements and deals with the desperate desire of spoils, along with a not-so-pretty picture of the Church.
Summary 3: I read a lot about this period in history so this book was a bit out of the ordinary but interesting.
Summary 4: This is the true story of a mother superior named Sister Benedetta Carlini and another nun from a small village near Florence in 17th century Italy who basically liked to rub bodies together in bed until they reached orgasm. This if course was a big no-no if you're a nun sworn to chastity. People found out and there was a trial in which the private sex life of these two nunnies was exposed. The scandal made them both lose their reputations. This is one of the earliest and most sensationalistic accounts of lesbian love on record. The fact that it was between two nuns makes it just that much more shocking and intriguing.(...)"
0756402905,Heartwood: Trickster's Game #1,"Summary 1: The best fantasy writers not only invite us to explore the magical, but guide us along the way with credible, world-building skills and sympathetic, recognizable characters that engage our imagination, but never tax our belief. Such is the case with Barbara Campbell's HEARTWOOD.I read this book over the course of a weekend in spring but for all I knew, I was not sitting in my backyard with the drone of cars and leaf-blowers and other modern ""conveniences"" competing for my attention. Instead, I was transported to the land of the Oak-Lord and the Holly-Lord where a Midwinter battle determined the advent of spring or the curse of a world locked in the frozen grip of winter.And it is ""heart"" that is the key word in this novel. While the fantastic descriptions will delight and frighten, the characters, from the troubled hero, Darak, to the wise, but aging Tree-Father,Struath, to the sadistic villain Morgath --all-- are ""known"" to us on some level. And that, in my opinion, is this author's greatest gift. Even the god Trickster, cunning, conceited and unpredictable as he is, reminds us of the times we wonder if our Maker doesn't have an unusual sense of humor.If you want to experience a seemingly lost world where the changing seasons are greeted with hope, awe and wonder versus large appliance sales, read HEARTWOOD. I can't wait for Ms. Campbell's next book.
Summary 2: Heartwood offers us a world where magic, shamans, spirits and gods are not metaphors to explain reality, but ARE reality. Heartwood tells the story of the spring that will not come because the battle between the sacred trees of the people has not gone according to custom. The balance of nature is off and a brave band of folk go off into the endless winter to see if they can set it right. On their journey they meet gods who walk the earth: a delightful Trickster, whose charm and sense of humor can almost make you forget the mischief he makes; a villain who can shape-shift by taking over the bodies of any living creature; a spirit-guide who offers assistance to the aging shaman. These classic elements of so many earth-based religions are here treated as reality, with sometimes terrifying...and always exciting...consequences.
Summary 3: After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter.Faced with the unimaginable, Darak sets out to both return balance to his world and save the brother who's caught up in the struggle. The characters are richly drawn, from the haunted Darak to the dark and oh so enticing Morgath.One of my biggest problems with fantasy novels is that the women seem to just be there to worry about the hero, hope he likes them, and get rescued. In Heartwood, Griane is as strong as Darak. They're delightful characters to revisit again and again. Heartwood was a fantastic read.
Summary 4: The tribe of the Oak has suffered tremendous losses due to plague but they still intend to observe the midwinter ritual where the Oak-Lord and the Holly-lord battle. Oak defeats Holly so that spring will arrive. Darak the hunter is not looking forward to this ritual because his beloved brother Tinnean will become Tree-Brother, apprenticed to the Tree father and will owe his allegiance to his master instead of his family.When it is time to travel to the dimension where the First Forrest lives, Darak refuses to join them and witness the loss of the brother who will be part of yet separate from the tribe. Something goes wrong at the ritual and the Oak and Tinnean disappear. Tinnean's body is inhabited by the Holly-Lord while the Oak and Darak's brother are in the land of Chaos, put there by the spirit of Morgoth, the evil Tree-Father, who held the position before Strauth killed him. Darak and his allies prepare to do battle to bring Tinnean back into his body and finish the rite so spring will return.Think Jean Auel and Judith Tarr and readers will have some idea what HEARTWOOD is all about. The setting feels prehistoric with magic an everyday occurrence. Darak is a strong stubborn man who loves deeply and wants to keep those he cares about close to him safe; when his brother is in danger he is willing sacrifices himself to free his sibling from the enemy. Barbara Campbell creates characters readers will care about and produces a storyline that grabs reader interest.Harriet Klausner"
037542282X,The Stone that the Builder Refused: A Novel,"Summary 1: I had read the first 2 books of this trilogy and looked forward to the third with a great deal of anticipation. After a hundred pages, however, I felt a sinking sensation as I realized that this story could not possibly have a happy ending. Bell had done such an excellent job realizing his characters that I felt deeply involved in their lives. After the horrendous atrocities of slavery and the slave revolts and subsequent battles, it seemed that the island was finally at some sort of peace.But what a price! Then as the French arrived to re-assert their primacy and General Louveture succumbs to hubris the precarious peace falls apart and the bloodshed begins again with blacks against whites.This last book completes the trilogy and tells a story that few of us know anything about. Haiti is a huge mystery to me and these books helped me understand a little why this country is the way it is. The legacy of slavery and the battles that were required to end it as well as the enduring suspicians between white and black are lessons for all of us even at this time (maybe particularly at this time).
Summary 2: The three novels in this series are the best historical novels I have ever read. They deal with a horrifying event, the slave rebellion in Haiti. Bell does not flinch from the horrors the contending groups and individuals inflicted on each other. The historical background is well covered in the plot and appendix. Written by a master novelist. Bell also covers fascinating subjects like the Voodoo mythos that still exists in Haiti today. Reading this novel, one begins to understand the chaos of Haiti today. A country born in this much bloodshed and hatred is destined for more. In terms of gallons of blood spilled, our own revolution was a mere skirmish.If you are at all interested in Haiti, race, relations, history, or just reading a good story, you should read this and the other two novels in the series, All Souls Rising and The Master Of The Crossroads.
Summary 3: This book was a masterful finish to a fantastic trilogy! If the subject were not somewhat obscure I am certain this series of books would be already be an American classic. I am so thankful for Professor Bell's exhaustive research and unparalleled writing skills. He brings the Haitian revolution to life. I have traveled back and forth to Haiti over the past 20 years and I will never look at the country or it's people in the same way! His development of characters and the seamless flow between chapters kept me in avid anticipation of my nightly reads. I am lost at the moment for what to read next!! If you want to understand the fierce national pride of the Haitian people this is a must read! Thank you Professor Bell!!!"
1583220488,Howard Zinn on History,"Summary 1: Howard Zinn's approach to history comes directly from his own life experience. He saw the baby boom part of the twentieth century history evolve before his eyes with major events, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the further activism that occurred thereafter, and the effects of the war on Vietnam with archival work, to name a few. HOWARD ZINN ON HISTORY is a collection of essays and articles previously published in notable journals and magazines, such as the Midwestern Archivist and Saturday Review. Zinn examines topics that have affected him academically as well as personally, and appear somewhat out dated but timeless at the same time because of how much has progressed from the time he originally wrote the pieces.The book may serve as a teaching tool for a political or American history classes because of its small format. It is the type of book that will raise questions for the casual history reader as well as the any history major. However, there are serious political overtones that resonate with the majority of the essays that may suggest Zinn's revisionist perspective on history, but he exposes the study of history and the sum of its parts. Zinn states: ""The scholar may swear to his neutrality on the job, but whether he be physicist, historian, or archivist, his work will tend, in this theory, to maintain the existing social order by perpetuating its values, by legitimizing its priorities, by justifying its wars, perpetuating its prejudices, contributing to its xenophobia, and apologizing for its class order"" (p. 167).Zinn opens the door to history as well as an inquiry into how it is shaped and formed. He probes important topics that have often been overlooked, which raises important questions, what can be considered history, and how long does it take to be history?
Summary 2: This is an essential book if a person wants to get an appreciation of what has taken place in the USA. It is highly informative . . . and disturbing, but vitally important to read. Howard Zinn writes with passion in his soul.
Summary 3: I have no background in history and do not pretend to know what I'm talking about in that regard. However, when it comes to grammar, I know what I'm doing - and Howard Zinn, apparently, does not. The chapter of this book that I was given (Chapter 8: On Presidential Liars) was the most horrendously written piece of work I've ever read. Please make note of the fact that I read high school essays frequently; I thought I'd seen it all. Apparently, I was mistaken. According to Mr. Zinn, the American people have been ""deceived about"" much more than we thought, and should all ""deep anguish"" over it."
B00005X3WJ,Voices of earth and sky; the vision life of the native Americans and their culture heroes,"Summary 1: I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.
Summary 2: Most people will know of the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth as a couple of old cruise liners -- many may have stayed at the Hotel Queen Mary in the ship's now permanent home in the waters of California. For a brief time, these ships were converted to military use in World War II to transport troops. On one occasion, the Queen Mary hit the British light cruiser HMS Curacoa, causing the ship to sink with the loss of hundreds of allied soldiers.Daniel Butler is a great historian and storyteller and he makes the wartime history of these two ships come alive. He doesn't start with the day the decision was made to use these cruise ships for military use. He sets the stage and gives the readers an understanding of the years leading to World War II -- not only giving a political and military background, but also telling us what was happening in the shipping industry that led to the construction of these two ships.To me the two most interesting parts of the book came when Butler tells about the most significant event of the Queen Mary's tour of duty (when the Curacoa was cut in two by her), and the most mundane (what it was like for a soldier to be transported on one of the Queens). If there is a weakness, it was here. I wish he could have had more first hand accounts from the surviving veterans who had crossed the ocean on their way to war. But of course, there are fewer and fewer such survivors still with us. Butler wrote this book just in time.
Summary 3: A very well written and researched book. Not only does the author tell the story of the two Queens in WWII. He also gives a nice history of trans-Atlantic shipping up to the point of the Queens construction and to the war. During the war years he tells of the Queen contribution to the war effort and also paints a good over all picture of the war so you can better understand their roll in it. This book is a great addition and read for those who have an interest in this subject.
Summary 4: I was looking all over for this book and finally found it on Amazon. This book is very interesting about the two ships, Queen Mary and her sister ship Queen Elizabeth. Churchill said that these two ships shorten WWII by one year. I found this book to be very interesting and to have a lot of information that I didn't know about. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history and WWII in perticular. There is a lot of information that can be found in this book, not only about the ships, but the war years too.
Summary 5: I was amazed to read how many troops the two Queens carried and did not sustain any damage. They both went on to serve for many more years after the war. Well built and well loved."
0205297714,Social Research Methods: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches (4th Edition),"Summary 1: This is a fabulous book for the novice researcher and an excellent resource/refresher for the experienced. Everything is laid out so clearly it is a pleasure to read--a no nonsense approach. I highly recommend it!
Summary 2: This text is well-written in easy to understand English. It gives the background behind the different kinds of research and then gives practical guidelines for carrying out the research.I can see that this book will not be too far away as I reflect, research and write up my current project.
Summary 3: Excellent review of statistics and their uses in social science research methods. Excellent examples to understand the different statistical concepts. Would recommend this book for masters and doctoral students."
0826320392,World War II and the American Indian,"Summary 1: This is a true story of intrigue, betrayal, social engineering gone awry, and oppression in America. Townsend's WWII AND THE AMERICAN INDIAN is primarily aimed at academics-- Native American studies professors in particular-- but this book is a revelation to those not already familiar with the many bizarre goings-on of the American government and its Right-wing critics in the tense years before, during, and after the war. Native American draft resistance, for example, was widespread-- contrary to the image of patriotic Indian, eager to defend ""his"" country.But most interestingly, the hidden question being explored in this work is: ""Is the enemy of my enemy my friend?"" History has forgotten Joseph Bruner, Alice Lee Jemison, and ""Chief Red Cloud,"" Native Americans who were quite willing to ally themselves with outright Nazis (both in America and in Germany) in order to advance their own political agendas. They had an understandable grudge against the BIA, and decided to make a deal with the devil.Fascist crazies like William Dudley Pelley reciprocated, all too happy to advocate Native American Liberation. Pelley even argued that Native Americans should be ""set free"" from their reservations-- to be replaced by American Jews.Roosevelt appointees in the federal government such as John Collier, BIA head, were briefly terrified by such plans, and actively combatted them with propaganda and prosecutorial muscle. They were troubled, in the 30s, by the prospect of a multicultural fascist front-- Gold Shirts from Mexico, Native Americans, German-American Bund members. and pro-Japanese Afro Americans, etcetera-- seizing power. Reading Townsend's book, it becomes clear that their fears were largely justified. What would have happened if the American fascists had succeeded? How would history have changed? Such tantalizing questions fill this book.Townsend tells us that the Germans knew all about Navajo code talkers before the war, and had sent an agent to the Southwest under the guise of an anthropological researcher, to help crack the code. Such German outreach to oppressed peoples in America was a lead-up to WWII.Also, John Collier, controversial BIA head, was one of the main architects behind Japanese American internment during WWII. His policies towards Native Americans were the template for the ""friendly"" Japanese concentration camps, many of which were erected on reservations. Collier, as a liberal, was the sworn enemy of the aforementioned Pelley-- and yet, ironically, both of them advocated concentration camps, albeit with different occupants. Such fascinating, dark ironies abound in Townsend's study. All along the American Indians are treated as pawns or noble primitives or mere symbols by the powers that be, the whites, even though the reader begins to suspect that those powers needed the Indians more than the Indians needed them...One helluva great read.
Summary 2: A very academic presentation of policies and attitudes towards Native Americans during WWII. Book focuses much more on policies and beaucratic process than individual Native Americas or their tribes.
Summary 3: I loved this book and it was great to learn about Native Americans. This book was apart of a class but after reading this I went and purchased the book about World War I."
0813533821,Francis Hodgson Burnett: The Unexpected Life of the Author of The Secret Garden,"Summary 1: Frances Hodgson Burnett was a celebrity and author of many runaway best-sellers from the 1870s to the 1920s and beyond. Now mostly remembered for her children's books, she had great fame for her romances and plays as well. This English-born author moved to the US as a child and became a true-life American rags-to-riches story. It is extremely interesting to learn how she was carried away by the resulting fame and fortune and what choices she made.I have always loved Frances Hodgson Burnett's books and am delighted that such a detailed biography is now available. I have read the previous accounts of her life but this book is especially well-written and contains plenty of new material. Highly recommended.
Summary 2: While during her life time (1849-1924), Frances Hodgson Burnett was best known for her many adult novels and plays, today it is for her children's books that she is remembered, especially for her masterpiece which has become a true classic and has never been out of print -- The Secret Garden. Frances Hodgson Burnett: The Unexpected Life Of The Author of ""The Secret Garden"" is an impressive and seminal effort in which biographer Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina (Professor of English, Bernard College, Columbia University) had the full cooperation of Burnett's descendants and relatives to help her examine and present an inherently fascinating life story of lively intelligence, contemporary sensitivity, and a wealth of new and never-before-published materials. From her modest beginnings in mid-Victorian Manchester, to her arrival in post-Civil ""War Tennessee at the age of 15 with her widowed mother and two sisters, this outstanding biography details her become the family breadwinner at the age of 17 and the eventual publishing of 52 books and 13 plays. This is also the story of her marriages, flirtations, and a scandalous affair, the troubled motherhood of two sons (one of whom become the model for Little Lord Fauntleroy). A welcome and much appreciated contribution to literary biographies, Frances Hodgson Burnett is enthusiastically recommended reading!
Summary 3: Frances Hodgson BurnettI love The Secret Garden, and that's the real reason for my getting and reading this book. But I have to agree (especially as a former editor) that the editing appears, at times, to be nonexistent. There were times when I simply shook my head because I was puzzled by such things as confusing pronoun referents. Still, I would recommend it to other lovers of Burnett's work, her life is that interesting.
Summary 4: What's good: The book is fully documented and the sources are mostly Frances herself and her trustworthy friends.What's not so good: The book is written in competent, though arid, prose. Not much enthusiasm for Frances comes through. The book gives the impression of being an academic project, undertaken because academics are required to do such projects and almost every other woman has already been done.Academic presses frequently have the authors do their own proof-reading, and this book is not well proofed. There are no glaring errors such as a spell-checker would find, but errors that would elude a spell-checker are not infrequent.Worse, there are at least two glaring factual errors:On page 286, the biographer states that ""President Roosevelt"" declared war in 1917, bringing America into World War I.On page 215, the biographer declares that in 1900, ""she was now forty-five."" On page 13, the biographer declares that ""Frances Eliza, the third child and first daughter, was born there too, on 24 November 1849."" A little arithmetic will demonstrate that in 1900, Frances cannot have been ""forty-five."" She was in fact 50 or 51.Still, for a Black British academic at Columbia University, the biographer is rather free of zeal, but she does insist on mentioning every Black maid which Frances, like other Southern women of the time, employed. However, she is forced to admit Frances' unswerving devotion to social equality, which she pushed in her novels.As to the question of ""flirtations,"" which are used to promote this biography, there is no evidence of them. Frances was extremely careful of her reputation (she had to be, since she was famous most of her life), and always traveled with a maid and usually a female companion as well. Whether Frances slept with Stephen Townsend during the ten years when he was around so much, one can only guess. But since he blackmailed her into marrying him in 1900 by threatening to tell the world they'd had an affair, it seems likely that there must have been some truth in it. On all occasions when she felt wronged, she threw herself publicly into the fray and defended herself indignantly. She was such a person that she could not have done that without truth on her side.Frances Hodgson Burnett was a remarkable human being, and a biography of her should be read, since for the last fifty years or so, we have been assured by academics, psychologists and self-appointed pseudo-intellectuals that humans cannot possibly be what she in fact was."
0130215325,Philosophic Classics: From Plato to Derrida (3rd Edition),"Summary 1: If you teach Introduction to Philosophy using a historical approach, this is the text I recommend. I used &quot;The Philosophic Classics 2nd edition, From Plato to Nietzsche&quot; for my classes and was looking for a text with the same basic works with some more contemporary materials. I find the updated 3rd edition, &quot;From Plato to Derrida&quot; the perfect solution. Instead of having to look through more textbooks for the right stuff, this is it.
Summary 2: Great study of major philosophies that have impacted our western culture. Very enjoyable and easy reading, yet stimulating and intellectual...Loved the book!
Summary 3: Another master piece for your books shelf. This work is more in depth and delves into snippets of the various authors' works. We are assigned this book in a class for MTh. An excellent resource, a book shelf keeper.
Summary 4: It Came to me pretty fast and was in good shape when I opened it. Very happy with it. Thanks
Summary 5: There is a huge range of authors in this book, and it includes most of the main ideas from each original passage. It can be sort of hard to follow at times, however, as it leaves out giant parts of arguments, especially in The Republic. This really breaks down the flow of the piece and renders it much more confusing than the original book."
0929775023,Twenty Years on the Cape: My Time As a Surfcaster,"Summary 1: This is one of my favorite fishing books. I'm reading it now for the third time. It's about a lifestyle that would make most of us jealous. If you enjoy surf fishing, then this book is a must.
Summary 2: This is not one of Daignault's better books, it reads like some poorly written nostalgic ego trip, with way too many paragraphs about beating out the regulations on beach buggy laws and surf casting that were put in place in the Cape in the 1970s. The title does certainly does not belie its contents: you indeed feel like it's been 20 years of Daignault on the Cape by the time you're finished reading it.
Summary 3: Reading this book for the first time or the twentieth time, is like being on the beach with a vibrant bass in the suds. You can almost feel the brine burning the line cuts in your hands. An extremly well written book by one of the absolute masters of surf casting. A must read for anyone who wants to know what it was like in the original glory days of striped bass fishing. I am one of the fortunate ones to own a signed copy of this book.
Summary 4: Okay, if you fish for stripers, this is a great book. If you have a family, this is a great book. If you remember the ""golden age"" of stripers, this is a great book. I don't see any reason not to get it. Yes, okay, the editing could have been tighter, but this is one of the classics for a striped bass angler. Frank has a way of describing things where you feel like you're there. Buy it, read it, enjoy it.
Summary 5: Great look at the past of striped bass fishing on the Cape. Money, politics and fishing competition made this a great read for the avid bass angler. A time never to be visited again. The man became intergrated into the life cycle of the striped bass. As the seasons and years changed , so did the man, so did the politics, so waned the competition, so lost was the inner workings of his family. A time to remember and a time remember less."
096723770X,Acting Across America,"Summary 1: For so long the shelves of any given bookstore have been crammed with books claiming to be &quot;the book that every actor needs&quot;, but yet they read like a foreign language and don't give the information an actor really needs for his or her big break. Ms. McGregor has broken through that barrier and released a book that spells out many of the details actors need to know about acting and the audition process. Intelligent and informative, the book is packed with everything an actor/actress could possibley need! A must for anyone trying to break into the business.
Summary 2: This book showed me that I dont have to live in LA or New York to get into acting. Also It gave me alot of helpful hints on all aspects in landing a role.
Summary 3: After reading this book, I couldn't stop shaking my head. I kept thinking to myself...why didn't I have this book years ago?? At first, I thought that there wasn't anything this book could teach me...I'm already an actor. Boy, was I wrong. If only someone had written this years ago, I could saved myself a lot of wasted auditions.
Summary 4: As an aspiring actor, I have taken many years of acting classes but always had a problem auditioning and nailing the part. Catrine McGregor's book made so much sense that everything really clicked into place. She covers every detail of the acting business from auditioning to unions. So many other books I've read contained facts but this book gives you clear, concise directions, examples, exercises, and the real inside scoop from an experienced casting director's point of view. my co-actors use it as a reference guide, too. I highly recommend it!!
Summary 5: A clear and concise guide to becomming a member of the acting community.A no bull map!A must for the neophyet actor caught in the maze of conflicting advise."
1564966755,Making Books by Hand: A Step-by-Step Guide,"Summary 1: This is a great book for any beginning bookbinder. The entire book features full-color photos with easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for many simple, but beautiful and impressive looking projects.First, materials and how to use them are covered. There are clear photos of all the materials. Then, the author demonstrates how to make corners for 3 different types of paper.Next, instructions are given for making several accordion books, a pamphlet stitch journal with either a soft or hard cover, a tied-binding album, &amp; a post album. Two gorgeous box books, &amp; a scroll are also demonstrated.There is a wonderful gallery in the back that really helped spark my creativity. Contact information on all the contributors is also included. A resource list and other suggested readings are a great bonus.
Summary 2: This book was excellent when my daughter and I decided to start making books together. It has some great simple ideas and teaches the basics in an easy to understand way. We have had a lot of fun with this little book!
Summary 3: The best thing about this book is the birds-eye-view photos of each step. The projects use only very basic stitching. I think this would be ok for a beginner, but I still think the best way to use how-to books like these is to take a class first; otherwise the steps can seem overwhelming.
Summary 4: The collaborative effort of self-employed book artist Mary McCarthy and educator/writer Philip Manna, Making Books By Hand: A Step-By-Step Guide is a direct, to-the-point, &quot;user friendly&quot; instructional guide to the art and craft of creating beautiful and useful scrapbooks, photo albums, diaries, blank books, and more. Full-color photographs illustrate each part of the process of crafting accordion art books, photo albums, box books, scrolls, etc. Making Books By Hand is commended as being first-rate guidebook for those interested in cultivating their skill in a unique and satisfying hobby, or who want to make exceptional and memorable gifts for friends and loved ones."
1930771142,You Can Have Your Cheese and Eat It Too!: A Complete Guide for Closing the Gap Between Where You Are and Where You Want to Be,"Summary 1: I prefer &quot;Cheese Cake&quot; (pun intended) but regardless, this book will tell you how to find it, have it, eat it, and keep it too.
Summary 2: A very entertaining read!! I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in improving themselves, either personally or professionally.
Summary 3: A very amusing story that explains how to be where you want to be, in the easiest and quickest way. The book helps readers see straight through chaos to appreciate the value of simplicity in their lives.
Summary 4: There are over 15 credible book endorsers for this new &quot;Cheese&quot; book which takes the hunt for your cheese to a new level. A must read for anyone interested in self-improvement. It is also a humorous read for mental health professionals and business managers alike."
0521531004,The Organic Codes: An Introduction to Semantic Biology,"Summary 1: Nowadays everyone has heard of the genetic code (in the singular). There is a certain amount of confusion in many people's minds, encouraged by the journalistic use of the phrase ""genetic code"" to mean what a biologist would call the genome, i.e. the complete DNA sequence for an individual. Nonetheless, there are plenty of good sources, ranging from the highly technical to the popular, to clarify the matter for those who want to be set straight.Marcello Barbieri is talking about something different, that is not only little known to the general public, but is also far less well known among biologists than it deserves to be. For him ""codes"" is plural, and he means more than just the familiar set of rules that say, for example, that when the triplet AAA occurs in an appropriate context in the DNA of a cell the aminoacid lysine needs to occur in the sequence of the corresponding protein. For Barbieri this is just one of numerous organic codes. Some of the others are also ""genetic"", in the sense that they involve reading more from DNA sequences than just aminoacid sequences, but others are not, as they involve information coded into structures such as sugars and histones that are not nucleic acids.All this should have considerable interest for the biologist even if we just stop there, but Barbieri goes on to build a theory of evolutionary complexity on the existence of multiple codes. Each time a new code appears during evolution it allows a large jump in the complexity of the organisms that possess it, but it does not replace earlier codes, which continue to be used, and it does not cause the simpler organisms to disappear. Thus modern organisms constitute a sort of pyramid in which the simplest organisms, the bacteria, use the ordinary genetic code and nothing else. The simplest eukaryotes add to the complexity by using splicing codes as well -- still in the genetic material, but now allowing fragments to be combined in different ways, and thus interpreted in different ways. The most recent of his codes to appear in evolution is language, which distinguishes our own species from all the others.
Summary 2: This book has a germ of an idea, but overall the author's exposition is confused and unconvincing. The big idea is that life is a set of organic codes and that codes imply meaning, hence the &quot;semantics&quot; in the title. Barbieri attemps to show that codes are necessary mappings between domains that e.g. allow information stored in the genome to be translated into the organism through development. A key point is that the genome contains insufficient information to fully describe the organism. From this, the author posits codes for other processes, e.g. exon splicing and signal transduction, although he offers no evidence and just suggests biologists haven't looked for them. He also tries to use his ideas to &quot;explain&quot; evolution, especially the Cambrium explosion of phyla.I found his ideas unconvincing. His ideas rest on his model of how complexity needs to be generated, based on algorithms to reconstruct CAT scan images. He uses a new term &quot;convergent increase in complexity&quot; to mean &quot;reconstructing a structure from incomplete information&quot;, which is based on these CAT scan image algorithms. However, a wealth of literature on cellular automata (finite state machines) shows that complexity can be generated by simple rules. Furthermore, repeatable, complex structures can be observed by these processes. If one needs convincing about this, just look at the biomorph images in Dawkins' &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; for taste of how simple rules can create complex, &quot;body plans&quot;. L-systems are another example.But despite his claims, Barbieri does not really offer falsifiable hypotheses and for this reason alone, it is difficult to understand how anyone can build on this work as a model of biology.Rather than thinking of codes as means to map information spaces, other workers have followed more fruitful approaches, e.g. how codes are used in information theory as a model to understand the biology. What is apparent from computational science, e.g. Holland's work on tagging systems, and wet biology, is that life needs to have systems that co-ordinate. Co-ordination becomes increasingly difficult as organisms increase in complexity and size. Biology seems to indicate that many approaches to communication used in industry have their surrogates in living systems.Barbieri comes over as a little petulant that his ideas have not be taken up by biologists. A quick search on the web showed that only people involved in a &quot;discipline&quot; called biosemiotics had looked at his work, and these texts reinforced the sense that incomprehensibity was used to mask lack of content. I hope I have given some reasons why this might be so.In conclusion, although I found this book in a biology section, it might have been better placed with the humanities.
Summary 3: The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."
1893110028,The Lost Village of Central Park (Mysteries in Time),"Summary 1: I had though the art of captivating storytelling in the realm of children's historical fiction was long gone. The last and one of the best was Ben and Me. Not to mention the fact that intelligent prose directed toward but not insulting children has disappeared with the likes of greats like E.B. White, Judy Blume &amp; Madeline L'Engle... until now that is. Meticulous research has allowed Hope Killcoyne to create a captivating historical backdrop that most New Yorkers weren't even aware of including myself. Even as the story unfolded I couldn't help feel a sense of sorrow knowing the timely end to what was probably a fascinating culture within the tapestry of NY. Nevertheless, Killcoyne takes what might have just been an interesting footnote in NY lore and weaves a modern folk tale of ingenious promise and heart. Characters well developed for any novel not to mention one for young adults, add depth and almost tangible realism to a time and era long forgotten and sometimes better off forgotten. Hope Killcoyne places her characters in a small pocket of the American landscape dwarfed by slavery and the dawn of Civil War allowing us to glimpse what might have been and what should be in a world too often blurred with self-interest and prejudice. Although some readers might be wary of the melodrama of a culturally diverse Utopia Killcoyne has pictured, there is nothing contrived about the story and intent behind this book. A highly recommended book for any young or old reader... from any walk of life.
Summary 2: I heard of this book through a personal connection, and I'm so glad I went to the trouble of finding it! I ordered it, thinking of my grandchildren, but I had a great time with it before I sent it on. It's written so that a young person can read it herself (it's a ""Chapter Book""), and an old person (me) can relate to the history and the location. There's no ""talking down"" in it.It tickles me that this all took place some four blocks from where I now live!
Summary 3: There are few opportunities offered our children to learn an important lesson about both our own past and our nature as individuals than that delivered by Hope Lourie Killcoyne in her gifted story, &quot;The Lost Village of Central Park.&quot; Set in mid-nineteenth-century New York City, at the cusp of the construction of that seminal landmark of modern America, Central Park, Ms. Killcoyne's lyrical narrative traces the factual history of Seneca Village, a real establishment in which African-American and Irish immigrants somehow co-existed peacefully in pre-Civil War America. Creating compelling and believable characters, Ms. Killcoyne provides today's pre-teens with an invaluable and unique perspective on an important era in American social development, one which was cut curiously short by the idiosyncratic yet poetically inevitable advancement of New York City, through the creation of Central Park. The Park stands today, a monument to New York civic achievement; what is lost is Seneca Village, perhaps an even more meaningful yet necessarily ephemeral reflection of all that is possible, yet also lost, in the American dream.
Summary 4: Having lived in New York my entire life, I was surprised to find out about Seneca Village. I was never taught about the time, place, and events that surrounded the demise of that area of the city. The author successfully tells the story from the point of view of two young girls, one black and one white, and the strength of their friendship. It's a great way to teach children about their past. There's a lot going on here... plenty to use the characters again and turn it into a series. I'd certainly pick up the next one for my niece!"
0312300794,The New York Times Weekend Challenge: Formidable but Fun Crosswords,"Summary 1: These puzzles are absolutely hilarious! Yet again, I'm blown away by the exquisite surprises, twists and turns. I've been stumped on a few of them for a few days now, but I'm not giving up! Shortz is, hands down, a genius. Try your hand at the masterful art within these pages, and enjoy the furrowed brow and laughs!
Summary 2: Oh where oh where are the crosswords that really make you THINK? I've been breezing through these and enjoying them, but I prefer a bit of a struggle.
Summary 3: This 6&#34;x8&#34; book of 75 Thursday, Friday and Saturday puzzles, is a terrific mix of difficulty. To top it off, the clues are legible (not too tiny for middle-aged eyes!), and the paper is a quality thick stock. Perfect for any solver who enjoys the challenge of using a pen without all the messy bleed-through to the next puzzle. I wish all the crossword books had such high quality!
Summary 4: Great value is right. Cheaper than paying the Times; cheaper than printing free Times puzzles from the Seattle Times website. Use a razor knife to cut the pages out and do them on a clip board."
0961662034,Everyday Magic: The Power of Memes,"Summary 1: Everyday Magic: The Power of Memes is traveling down a well worn road. Ken Renshaw resurrects the ideas of Mesmer, suggestibility; Freud, that sometimes fears are disguised wishes; Alfred Adler and family influences; the archetypes of Carl Jung; even Eric Berne's concept of ""scripts"" all are stuffed into a vast system of ""memes."" These memes are vaguely defined as just about any idea that prompts you to behave in one way or another. There is no discussion of drives or reinforcement, and very little on habits or another psychological concept, ""magical thinking.""However, this is not all bad. In fact, it may be good. What Renshaw has done is simplify how to understand why you do dumb stuff and how to stop doing dumb stuff. His thinking is similar to Harold Greenwald's direct decision psychotherapy approach first presented in the 1960's suggesting that people should decide what payoffs they want and do whatever it is that accomplishes that. Gestalt, rational-emotive, even NLP fans will be attracted to his approach.He says two things very well. First, that if you believe something to be true, you will live in such a way that it becomes true. Second, that you can change this pattern. For this reviewer, he spends too much time on the former and too little on the latter.I found one concept to be especially useful. Years ago, a rival of Alka Seltzer showed an ad on television where two tablets were plopped into a glass of water and began to fizz, releasing all that medicine. Almost immediately, a hand reached in and pulled them out, showing that there was nothing special in what was happening with the tablets and bubbles. The message was; there was no magic in those dissolving tablets-you can safely switch to another product. Renshaw's message is equally clear; that there is no magic in your current memes. They are just the ""spell"" you're currently operating from and that you can change it when you want.To include all he does under the definition of a meme is not a true meaning of the concept nor faithful for how complex we humans are. At the same time, if you're looking for a simple way to understand why you do what you do, this is a good place to start. He gives you tools to take a clear look at who you are and what you want to be and left me with the clear impression that although we are buffeted by the memes of others, we are responsible for what we become and have the opportunity to take control over it.Although overly simplified for my taste, Renshaw does a good job of making sense of life and offering practical ways of improving it. His enthusiasm for the topic is clear. I think sitting down for a cup of coffee with him for an hour or so would be enlightening. Second best is to read his book, which I recommend doing.
Summary 2: This book is a very informative, yet easy read about the realities of life and how patterns are repeated sometimes even unknowingly until honestly addressed and changed. That is where the power of this book lies in giving insight, tools, all with a touch of humor to make positive changes of direction in our lives. Highly recommend.
Summary 3: The author takes the concept of ""memes"" into everyday life for the reader. This book is also very personal on the author's life history. As an introduction to our individually selected attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, it is very easy reading and the examples help our self understanding."
0738818062,Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance,"Summary 1: &quot;I have worked for 10 years with public school students who have Emotional Behavior Disorders (EBD), at the elementary, middle and high school levels. I wish I had read &quot;Emotional Honesty &amp; Self-Acceptance&quot; when I was in graduate school as it is tremendously useful in working for EBD students. I am generally disappointed with affective materials available to use with these students, as exercises and activities are often superficial, and kids know it. The concept of emotional honesty is simple to understand and rings true. It is truly a helpful tool when communicated appropriately, which Ron Brill does quite effectively in his book. The information is here to use or not use according to the readiness of the individual facing emotional stumbling blocks. This book can also help support and maintain the emotional health of teachers as well. It has certainly been personally very helpful to me. Many of my students told me up front that they were desperate to find something that could actually make some difference in the misery they face every day. The anger and depression present in most students seems so overwhelming and crippling, no wonder teachers and counselors are also unprepared for the emotional distress that pervades our schools. Many families are also overwhelmed to the point they also need emotional health education adocated in this book. It is simply one of the most important books I have ever read. The author presents so much potentially threatening material in a non-threatening way that it is easy to accept. This is a simple but powerful repair tool for complex emotional/behavioral problems we all face today.&quot;
Summary 2: In his book Emotional Honesty, Ron Brill contributes to our basic understanding of human emotions. This readable book will be of enormous value to classroom teachers, parents, and others who live or work with children/adolescents because the author carefully explains the distinctions between &quot;healthy&quot;--and the more common &quot;unhealthy&quot;--manner in which we deal with our own feelings as well as the feelings of others around us. In light of our nation's current inability and/or unwillingness to meet the emotional needs, issues, and problems of millions of our children, I believe that this book provides an excellent basis for individual and group study and reflection.
Summary 3: Ronald Brill's Emotional Honesty &amp; Self Acceptance is an excellent resource for everyone, especially those working with children. The strategies in this book helped me turn ""wounds into wings"" with hurt high-risk teens in a community school. I have witnessed angry, self destructive, depressed and suicidal teens turn around and express their internally trapped hurt and sad feelings in a safe place, the classroom.
Summary 4: As Ron Brill writes about the principles of emotional honesty, he is able to shed light on the mysterious world of emotions. He examines the pretenses and hidden defenses that children and adults employ as emotionally dishonest ways to deal with (or avoid dealing with) hurt feelings. He offers specific strategies to help people become emotionally honest by accepting, listening to, and taking responsibility for painful feelings. Teachers can play a critical role in this emotional education process, providing students with the skills that will enable them to handle their everyday wounds immediately, openly, and honestly before they build up and erupt into violence or self-destructive acts.As mentor to elementary school children and as grandmother of two teenagers and four preteens, I found this book fascinating and very helpful. I better understand the painful and wounding feelings that young people struggle with. I believe this will enable me to be a more sensitive, active listener as I encourage young people to share and explore their feelings. This book is an excellent resource for teachers and parents. Ron Brill paves the way for a critical new discipline of emotional education as he opens the door to honest communication."

B000HVVJQ6,The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash,"Summary 1: Often unheard of poet, Ogden Nash, serves as a reminder that poetry itself does not need to be mushy, polite or romantic. Or for that matter psychological, philisophical or religious. Nash's poetry, written from the early 20's to the late 50's is remark on the social niceties. A critique of the love-hate relationship of men and women. A funny peek into the lives of animals. And silly stories for the sake of being silly. The uniqueness in Nash's work is not the poetry itself, but his play with words. Its clear he does not take language seriously at all which allows him to mix and maneuver words to create new ones that will create a genuine laugh. Such as: &quot;Well I have learned that life is something about which you can't conclude anything except that it is full of vicissitudes. And when you expect logic you only come across eccentricitudes.&quot; The other aspect of Nash's writing is his outlaw verse where, although things rhyme, the rythm is thown askew.&quot;I know that a year has rolled around once moreWhen I find myself thumbing a crisp new cigarette lighter just like the coven of other cigarette lighters strewn on a shelf in the garage along with the broken tire chains and the license plates for 1934.&quot;Nash's work was surely ahead of its time and I am dleighted to have come across such remarkable work. I highly reccomend this, not just to poetry lovers, but also to those that appreciate language and humor.
Summary 2: I don't really enjoy reading poetry, and I don't suggest reading volumes of poetry at a time. I do, however, suggest reading this book of Ogden Nash, reading the poems individually instead of as a collection. Some may find his verse stupid, some simple, but I find it charming.
Summary 3: I love this guy's wit and his clever creation of words to fit many, many subjects. Nash's poems are good for many laughs while causing you to think about the joys in life. Nash is a clever guy!
Summary 4: This was an excellent book if u are in the dumps and want to laugh, I sure did, it pulled me out of my 12 year depression, after i read this book i decided to go after my life long dream of becoming..."
0595129463,Marshall Hollenzer is Driving,"Summary 1: This author is as aware of conflict and drama as he is of the magic of the rhythm in a sentence, and that makes for some beautiful reading.Egerton's characters and his story are equally strong and thoughtful, and his unique sense of humour makes for a terrific navigator. The emotions of each character ring true, and each situation seems natural to identify with, no matter how bizarre or dreamlike.This novel is a shiny pebble you want to keep in your pocket, its wisdom executed with style and skill. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys having their wet head wrapped in a big, soft, warm towel.
Summary 2: Marshall Hollenzer is Driving tugs at the mind and the heart enveloping three sets of people travelling towards a common understanding of themselves, the world and what it all means. If you need to lose yourself in a wonderful story, this book will provide you with hours of imaginative wisdom.Thank you Owen for writing this book.
Summary 3: I picked up this book and could not put it down. It kept me up most of two nights. The stories of three very different characters whose lives intertwine in unexpected ways take us on a journey of the discovery of our true human nature, a God at work behind the scenes, and inverted expectations. A nice dose of magical realism in Marshall's character creates some delightful and poignant moments which are metaphors for how easily we delude ourselves about what we really believe. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story.
Summary 4: Eggerton successfully blends humor and tragedy in this, his debut novel. While weaving three sets of seemingly unrelated characters into one neat package, Eggerton takes the reader on an emotional ride of spiritual discovery. His characters are likeable, and the type that we, as readers, come to care about and share in their ups and downs. Altogether, a great read."
0449002330,His Grace Endures (Regency Romance),"Summary 1: Lucas, the Duke of Canover, fell in love with Deirdre when he first saw her, but--not being adept at showing his feelings--he conspired with her social-climbing father to make her his wife, instead of wooing her. Severely beaten by her father when she tried to refuse, Deirdre was desperate to escape, and did not fight her attraction to his best friend Jonas, who convinced her to run from the altar into his arms and a hasty marriage at Gretna Green.Seven years later, a widowed Deirdre, despising the false values of the ton and valuing her quiet life at the Scottish cottage she and Jonas had shared during their marriage, finds it necessary to return to the London to sponsor her beloved sister-in-law on the Marriage Mart. When she and Lucas meet again after that disastrous wedding-that-never-was, sparks fly between them and rumors abound that Lucas is a blackguard who broke her heart and is determined to get revenge. The truth, however, is that Deirdre discovers that he is not the blackguard she believed him to be. In fact, he is a fine, worthy man who wanted--and surprisingly still wants--only to love her the rest of her life. Does she have the courage to forsake the quiet life in the Scottish countryside for marriage to a man she thought she despised for seven years? Will Lucas make the same mistake of letting her go without a fight?Although I started this book late in the evening and planned only to read a chapter or so, I found myself completely engrossed and could not stop until I had finished it. I will definitely look for more books by this author.
Summary 2: The widowed Deirdre Macvail has absolutely no desire to leave her lovely Scottish cottage and journey to London for the Season. Certain that the ton remembers her scandalous departure from Society, she is reluctant to face their censure -- and even more reluctant to face the man who precipitated it. Unfortunately, Deirdre promised to bring out her young sister-in-law, so to London they must go. With a stop enroute to attend a party in Edinburgh.Lucas Gower, the Duke of Conovar is a Corinthian, a war hero, and the most eligible catch on the Marriage Mart. He's also a man whose heart was broken seven years earlier. Deciding that he needs an heir, Lucas determines to look over the marriageable misses and choose a wife.Deirdre's and Conovar's first encounter is memorable. Deirdre describes it: &quot;In all the times she had imagined the meeting, in all the frightening scenarios, she could never have predicted it happening in Scotland. Nor could she have prophesied the dilemma in which she would find herself. For she could not quite decide which was worse: facing the man whom she had jilted quite literally at the altar seven years earlier, or facing the man who had killed her husband. Not that it mattered, really. Both were standing in front of her, in the single, impeccable form of the Duke of Conovar.&quot;After several chance meetings, Lucas realizes that, far from hating Deirdre, he still loves her. Deirdre realizes that Lucas isn't the cold, heartless, arrogant man she knew -- or thought she knew -- seven years earlier. Well, he's still arrogant, but he's neither cold or heartless.Are there really second chances? Will hope and love triumph over all the hurt, the misunderstandings, and the misconceptions of the past?Emma Jensen's very readable style makes the Regency era come alive for modern misses, the interplay between her characters sparks and sizzles, and her dialogue sparkles.You'll find marvelous characters, acerbic wit, a chuckle or six, a mystery to solve, a! nd a moving story of enduring hope and love. What more can a reader want?
Summary 3: I'd never read any of Emma Jensen's books before this one, and I'll now be searching out more. This is a wonderful book; Ms Jensen demonstrates some great skills of storytelling, characterisation and emotion in this tale of a widow who has to confront and deal with the man she jilted seven years earlier and who she believes to have been ultimately responsible for her husband's death. And yet she discovers that the Duke of Conovar is nothing like she imagined. And very soon, because of the cruel gossip which starts to spread about him, she becomes his staunchest defender rather than his enemy.There are some heartwrenching scenes in this book, as well as some dialogue which had me glued to the page. It's impossible not to be touched by Conovar's sincerity or Deirdre's anguish as each finds out that they were mistaken about each other and about other characters whose actions impinged on their lives and destroyed their relationship seven years earlier.I thoroughly recommend this book, and I'm completely bemused by Susan Johnson's review, below.

Summary 4: Without quite realizing it, I appear to have been picking up several RITA winners among traditional Regencies. One such book was Butler's The Rakes' Retreat. Another was this one (Jensen won another RITA for A Grand Design, before moving on to historicals).This is a book hard to describe easily. It had an irresistible first chapter (from the publisher's website but a deeply buried section) where the widowed heroine Deirdre is coaxing and cajoling her spoiled young sister-in-law to get ready for the ball. When she arrives, she has to continue worry about Olivia who has expressed her determination to marry only an earl (or at least an earl). Deirdre is not comfortable with society, and we find out why in the last paragraph of the first chapter - she has jilted a highly eligible suitor at the altar and eloped to marry her late husband. And you can guess what is about to happen - the rejected suitor arrives at the ball in Edinburgh. He is a duke, no less, the man whom Deirdre jilted and humiliated so publicly, and the man who was responsible for her husband's death.As the book progresses, some of our preconceptions from the first chapter are demolished in rapid succession. Deirdre misses her late husband, but she is *not* ""Deirdre of the Sorrows"" as she has been labelled by the ton. She was not a heartless jilt. She ran away from a marriage into which she had all but been sold by her social-climbing parents. Her fiance was not a duke then, but a second son of a duke. And the man she was to marry was the heir to a baron. Deirdre has a strong sense of her own self-worth, and she ran away from the church in part because she was not asked whether she wanted the marriage, and in part because the groom gave no sign of loving her.So, the Duke is a heartless peer out to marry the prettiest face around, or is he? That is the idea society now has about him, thanks to rumors spread by a mysterious person or persons. Conover (the duke) believes that either Deirdre or her sister-in-law must be responsible but cannot blame them entirely. He failed to convince Deirdre of his real love for her then, and he fails to do so now. In fact, revelations about his actions past and present have a way of coming back to haunt him. Not to mention that a nasty spat he and Deirdre have in public backfires on him more than on her. So much for Deirdre's belief that the ton would take the Duke's side. Even his friend's mother Lady Hythe publicly chastises him - more than once.All this explains the title ""His Grace Endures"" (one of the harder to find Jensen titles). For the rest of the book, Conover must confront the effect of his past actions or inactions, and he must also unmask the person who is slandering him. But there are no black villains here. Conover's enemy, for want of a better word, has his reasons.The book was wonderful, with meditative dialogue by Conover and others, with surprise built upon surprise. There was Galahad, the incontinent monkey and the stiff Earl of Hythe and his prudish mother (who will appear to greater effect in another Jensen book BEST LAID SCHEMES). There is also a reference to the heroine of WHAT CHLOE WANTS.However, the book was ever so slightly lacking in passion. While I could understand Conover's regrets over the past (and his constant thoughts of Deirdre helped here), I did not get the sense that Deirdre was in love with him, although I realized that she was not indifferent to him of course. What was the hardest was identifying when and how Deirdre had fallen for Conover. Did she love him even as she was eloping - and listening for his voice at every stop? Did she love him only when another elopement was prevented? The answer did not strike me.The second problem was the ending. It seemed too abrupt, and not in keeping with either Conovar's or Deirdre's characters. This was a minor problem but one that spoiled the book slightly for me along with the other issue I mentioned.Rating 4.2Recommended: Highly
Summary 5: I was so disappointed in this book. Since it was the 1998 RITA award as best regency, and beat &quot;Lord Heartless&quot; for that win, I was expecting a terrific novel. Instead, the book drags and the characters act in such an unrealistic ways. As far as the Duke goes, our hero, he has no family or friends. The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america. I usually like Emma Jensen's books. There was nothing romantic about the book. Only a creepy feeling at the way society ended up treating the Duke."
B0007EWYKS,The great controversy between Christ and Satan: The conflict of the ages in the Christian dispensation (Her Conflict of the ages series),"Summary 1: If I were to choose one book on Bible prophecy ~ This is it! It was written in 1888 by a woman (Ellen G. White) who left this world at the age of 85 in 1915. Even so, it beats anything published today. Although she does not cover everything in this post 1948 generation (i.e.re- birth of Israel, True Names of the Father and Son, television, and etc.), you will only be helped by prayerfully reading this book! Blessings if you do!
Summary 2: From the begining of this book, to the very end, you will note that the author has listed key events in history which explain in infinite detail, their relation to biblical events.Everything is very detailed, and if you are searching for answers related to history, government, economics, politics, & future events - this book will explain, and alert you to the future difficulties that we are yet to experience.
Summary 3: An inspired account of the conflict between Christ and Satan and includes the last day events that God's church will experience and the second coming of Jesus."
0816519382,Tequila: A Natural and Cultural History,"Summary 1: This book gave me a overview of tequila that included the agricultural considerations, cultural heritage, and history of mescal de tequila, not just a guide to making margaritas. It is well written with enough detail to satisfy the curious, yet straightforward enough to allow for the average reader. Exceptionally informative book!
Summary 2: If you ever wonder how tequila is made, find out what an amazing process it is. Buy this book.Full of incredible rich photographs, that depict the everyday beauty of Mexico.
Summary 3: I purchased this book at a museum garden in Arizona a year ago and just got around to reading it. I was enthralled. The book has more about the wonders Agave than just tequila but it has enough fun to keep a non-botanist reading. I have never before yearned to go to Jalisco and sample from the various distilleries. I learned a great deal about pulque, aguamil, and the Spanish influences of distillation. I have since tasted several tequilas and mescals and I appreciated them more than ever.
Summary 4: There's no doubt the authors know their subject. Sadly where this falls short is the lack of a good editor to massage the text into greatness. If you appreciate good tequila, this is well worth reading--great history and background on the region. It's a shame they missed the opportunity for creating the definitive book on the subject. Better editing and good photography would have made this a 5-star book. Still, it's a lot better than the other pithy books on tequila with froufrou recipes and questionable history.

096278415X,The National Review Treasury of Classic Children's Literature,"Summary 1: Compiled and edited by William F. Buckiley, Jr., the Treasury Of Classic Children's Literature is an anthology of enduring stories for young folk, painstakingly selected and compiled by William F. Buckley, Jr. for their lasting appeal across the generations. Works by Jack London, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, Thorton W. Burgess, Palmer Cox, and others, are embellished with black-and-white illustrations in this timeless and memorable anthology which is a welcome and recommended addition to school and community library Children's Literature anthology collections.
Summary 2: Searching for a read-aloud book that you might share with your children, you would score a consensus winner with this compendium of rich, highly captivating tales. The two selections from Jack London, ""In Yeddo Bay"" and ""To Repel Boarders"" were springboards for our youngsters beyond this book and on to ""The Call of The Wild"" and ""White Fang."" Similarly, short fables from Louisa May Alcott and Lewis Carroll opened our ears to continue with more famous, longer works by those authors. Rudyard Kipling's ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"" and Mowgli's Brothers"", ""Tommy and the Meadowmice"" by Thornton W. Burgess, ""Juggerjook"" by L. Frank Baum, creater of Oz, and ""The Voyage of the Northern Light"" by John Townsend Trowbridge each held my kids' attention as we read them aloud at dinner or at bedtime. The inestimable Mark Twain weighs in with a novella ""Tom Sawyer Abroad"" that is a perfect followup to a summertime reading of ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" There is plenty of selection here for everyone to be happy. Give your kids the gift of colorful, imaginative literature...then read it aloud with them.If Mr. Buckley's politics or his pomposity is a bother, worry not about it here...he pens a pithy pre-amble, and among the classics also includes a modern-day computer adventure entitled ""The Temptation of Wilfred Malachey."" Just plain fun!
Summary 3: This collection of 38 stories selected and compiled by Bill Buckley is drawn mostly from the old St. Nicholas Magazine for children. The stories are of varied length (less than 10 pp. to more than 50). Although the authors and stories are of excellent quality (Kipling, Baum, Twain, Burgess, London, etc.), I would have liked some more variety."
0962343528,Goju Ryu Karate Do: Fundamentals for Traditional Practitioners,"Summary 1: Excellent book with lots of pictures and philosophy of karate. The spiritual side of karate is explored as well.
Summary 2: This is the most informative series on Goju Ryu in print. Absolutely a must for all goju-ryu karate-ka.
Summary 3: It was a very good book. It explains in full detail the history of Goju-ryu karate. It also has step by step instructions for katas with black and white pictures. Almost every page has a picture. This book also has a glossary with the Japanese terms translated from Japanese to English and English to Japanese with the phoenetic pronunciation. Motoo Yamakura is a very good martial arts writer."
0312929358,Wet Work,"Summary 1: 'In 1986, Architectural Digest asked me to do a piece on Malcolm Forbes's yacht, the Highlander,' the 38-year-old writer said in a telephone interview from his New York City office. Mr. Buckley said he learned that Forbes was planning a journey from Manaus, Brazil, to Iquitos, Peru, with the billionaire John Kluge. 'I was casting around for a book idea and thought, &quot;There's one -- a comedy of manners about two billionaires going up the Amazon to the heart of darkness.&quot;' -Interview with Andrew Yarrow, NY Times Book ReviewI suppose there's some sense in which it's unfair to hold an author's successes against him, but Christopher Buckley's other books are so good, that this one, though adequate, seems terribly disappointing. He's taken the scenario above and turned it into a kind of cross between A Man in Full and Death Wish. When billionaire industrialist Charlie Becker's beloved granddaughter Natasha dies of a drug overdose, he sets out to wreak his terrible revenge on the entire drug apparatus responsible for her death. By the end of the novel, he's, you guessed it, on board his yacht in the Amazon on pursuing a Peruvian cocaine kingpin.There are many funny lines and the action is thrilling enough, though it does go on longer than it needs to. I suppose that if this was the first novel I'd read by Christopher Buckley I might be more lenient, but knowing how much better he's capable of, this one just gets the slightest of recommendations. Try Little Green Men or The White House Mess instead.GRADE : C
Summary 2: I bought this book to see if my fond memories of C. Buckley which were jolted by his latest effort ""Supreme Courtship"" could be calmed and massaged.This book started out like a fine walk in the woods and then got into somewhat muddy grounds and then a bit swampy and finally quicksand. Sorry. Three stars is the best I can do and I don't even feel that I want to justify it.
Summary 3: Not Buckleys best but an entertaining read anyways. Obviously written early in his career. Funny and Clancy-esque.Still worth the time.
Summary 4: Wet Work is one of Buckley's earlier works. I personally prefer his later works, but that is me. I'm still a sucker for anything Buckley writes. At first I thought the dialog was somewhat confusing, but as I read on the characters took over and the story became even funnier.In my opinion the ending was one of his best. Wet Work as a whole wasn't Buckley's best, but it was still worth my time to read it.The slower than usual start was the reason for four stars (4.5, but I'm not rounding)."
0520083008,Storm from the East: From Genghis Khan to Khubilai Khan,"Summary 1: This is a great overview of the part of Mongolian history that most intrigues westerners, the years of the great Khans. It is a very accessible book that doesn't require any prior knowledge on the part of the reader, and hopefully inspires them to look deeper into the people and the nation of Mongolia.In the west we've all heard of Ghengis Khan, and we have our preconceptions of ""barbarian"" cultures or the terrible hordes of Mongol warriors; the reality behind the myths and legends is well worth knowing. I first encountered the ""Storm from the East"" video series on TLC and it has since re-played {but rarely} on THC. The film or video is only on offer to educational institutions at a very high price, so the most a layman can hope for is a quality tape from TV -or- this book.The book follows the video script almost verbatum, with many of the same maps, diagrams and stills from the live footage shot in Mongolia. It's a wonderful substitute, and an easy to digest history lesson.The relationship of the medieval Mongolian nation to China and the western European nations is fascinating, and thanks to ""Storm from the East"" it is easily understood. The book is written with a gentle sense of humor, but does not belittle nor aggrandize the Mongolian people or the historical Khans.
Summary 2: I love the occasional suprises in life; you know the very unexpected which enriches you forever.When I bought this book I really wasn't interested in Ghengis Khan but I thought maybe I could find out more about the group. Well, the book ws written beautifully which madefollowing the sory and timeline very easy.I found the author had a scholastic approach to the subject which is what I sought and had the ability to incorporate mady other aspects tpo the Khans which gave me the unusual perspective that I always desire. You know the knowledge that lets you lord over others who happen to feel they are experts and expect that noone else knows. Thats my kind of fun.Anyway, the book incorporates the necessary maps and some beautiful artwork that really enhances the book. Unfortunately, I mark up all of my good book with underlines, exclamation points and many many stars for futile future referenceThe only criticism I can offer is that beside his references to many of the major cities that he invaded and then re-constructed there was no mention of the modern names of these places which requers me to search them out on the internet.If you are a history lover and want a dry but fascinating look at this period, BUY THIS BOOK!I fmr: Marshall reads this- well thank you for writing this book you have given me the power of knowledge.
Summary 3: This is a great history book on the great Mongol Empire. It clears up a lot misunderstandings and superstitions about the supposedly horrible Mongol barbarians and gives a reliable account of their rule in this time period. It covers Temujin's (aka Genghis Khan) beginnings to the end of his forebears rule. It has pictures from the past and of re-enactments of Mongol cavalry - you will rarely find this elsewhere. The Mongol Empire was a militaristic nation, so this book lacks on the military strategy and warfare of the Mongols. Only the basics are covered."
B000PXNN4C,Pictures of the Night,"Summary 1: I waited a long time for this to be republished in England. It begins just as the other two did, 'once upon a time', but Bella is actually speaking the words. I was looking forward to this book, not only for the story and the wrapping up of Alice's and Megan's tales, but also to discover Bella's mind.Bella is the most flamboyant and rebellious of the trio: she is constantly compared to Carmen throughout the trilogy, a nod to the allure she has for men and her troubles with them, and she is the one who keeps up with popular culture. However, although Bella loves Elvis and other rock'n'roll singers, she is deeply touched by the world of jazz and the blues. And this is a perfect example of her character: though she can seem shallow, arrogant and irritating, inside Bella is actually quite thoughtful. The agony of the blues and jazz touches her because she has had sadness in her life, the dynamics of the original fairytale being unchanged. As before, the stepmother, whom Bella wanted to love, despises her beauty and does everything she can to stifle her spirit. Therefore, Bella is, in fact, probably the most isolated of the trio, because she seems the most invulnerable. Geras brilliantly reveals the insecurities behind Bella's faade: her doubts about love, just as real as Alice's and Megan's; her distress about what happened to Alice (she was the one, after all, who decided to protect her that first night); and most of all, is Marjorie really as hostile as Bella thinks she is, or is she really being 'melodramatic' as everyone else says?The sense of doom that permanently hovered over 'Watching the Roses' is subtly changed here into a creeping suspicion, as Geras brilliantly mimicks what happened to Snow-Drop in the original fairytale, even managing to get the bit about Bella's colouring. Bella adores to sing jazz and blues, to get rid of her agony, and even the title of the story comes from a song in the story which is about chasing the blues away. The meeting of her 'prince' in Paris, on a holiday after her A-levels, is incredibly romantic, but typically the course of true love does not run smooth and he disappears, leaving Bella vulnerable.As both Megan and Alice's tales reach their end, Bella feels left out, remarking that 'it would never, never be only the three of us ever again'. Where is her happy ending? And why does she keep seeing a white cat every time something strange happens...?This story is powerful, but also sensitive as it probes Bella's mind, her defiance of the adult world and rules as personified by her stepmother, her refusal to pity herself, but also her longing for love, the one who is protected instead of the one who protects. However, it does make you wonder what it was like for Megan alone on holiday with Dorothy, and what Alice did in France. And what is Bella going to do after the end of the story? Marjorie is especially well-detailed: her jealousy of Bella is increasingly sinister, but Geras also ridicules it, and gives the reader the satisfaction of a kind of show-down between the two. Bella herself emerges as a fully rounded character, and the story ends in a very romantic, upbeat way, typical of her. Yes, there is sex, but as before it is dealt with as a fact of life, something that girls on the verge of womanhood would obviously think about. 'Pictures of the Night' will not disappoint fans of the series.
Summary 2: The third and final installment of the Egerton Hall series, _Pictures of the Night_, is a retelling of the Snow White story. Our heroine this time is Bella, the most flamboyant, rebellious, and wild of the three girls. This is the only one of the books not told in a diary format, which I found to be an excellent touch, since I could never see Bella sitting down long enough to write a journal.Wanting to get away from her jealous stepmother, who is upset because her hairdresser thinks Bella is prettier, Bella crashes at the house of a band, the Magnificent Seven, with whom she sometimes sings. They get a gig in Paris, and Bella runs off with them for the summer, telling her father and stepmother that she's staying with a friend's aunt. She finds ecstasy on stage, and two very different kinds of love, but always there is a whiff of fear in the air. For Bella is constantly meeting strange women, women who remind her of her stepmother, who rave of her beauty and then give her gifts which always somehow result in Bella becoming ill. Then she returns to Egerton for the fall term, and she and her friends discuss their future plans, and Bella does a lot of soul-searching. And the band is getting ready to play one last big show--and this time her stepmother will be in the audience.Bella can be obnoxious, shallow, and callous, but I accept that, because making her &quot;sweetness and light&quot; wouldn't be true to the Bella we saw in the first two books. My only gripe is that Miss van der Leyden does not appear in this book. Dear Ms. Geras: Please write a book about everyone's favorite housemother. There must be a story there.
Summary 3: I just couldn't get into this book. Right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. Also, it contained too many long descriptions. Not my type of book."
0399524460,Desktop Yoga,"Summary 1: I think this book should be in every office drawer, especially for those of us who sit at computers all day long. This book really does what the title says, you can perfom many yoga poses in your office no matter what you're wearing.This short book covers breathing techniques, proper posture, quick yoga poses that can be done anywhere at any time. If you're always feeling tired and stiff at work, pick up this book and try a few of the suggestions. I take a 10 minute &quot;yoga time out&quot; every hour and I find that I'm less sluggish and less stressed.
Summary 2: While this book provides great descriptions of the positions, there are very few images for reference. For one to truly practice yoga, posture and alignment are extremely important -- if trying these positions without a guide, you may not receive the same benefits. Ask your yoga instructor to go over the proper postures before you practice them on your own.
Summary 3: Provides many yoga-based stretching exercises that are great for people who spend a lot of time working at a desk or some other sort of sedentary occupation.
Summary 4: I like this book because it gives you quick exercises you can do at your desk. Sometimes I use them when I begin to feel pain. I look in the book and go to the section that contains the area that hurts and just slowly do a couple of sets. Then I relax and in about 10 minutes I do them again. After a while I can feel some relief. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue so sometimes by body hurts everywhere. I will do some of the exercises in my car on the way to work or I will go into my car at lunch and rest with my ipod playing some relaxing music or guided imagery. Usually helps enough so I can finish my day."
0943173698,A Kids' Guide to Building Forts,"Summary 1: My review may seem a bit rambling & repetitive but its an early morning for me while the kids are still sleeping. Just take in consideration, I encourage you to GET THIS BOOK! SPEND TIME with your kid{s} utilizing it before they become older and you missed out on all the fun you could of had with them. making those memories that last a lifetime of smiles. Now grab your coffee/tea for why I personally find this book to be of a dying breed. Much love to the Author & publishers for sharing the Kids guide to building forts &lt;3 .Despite what a reviewer has wrote about ""safety"" no where in this book does it say to hand it over to the kid and leave them to do it ALONE. This book is perfect for the adult to SHADOW but in no way means for them to let the kid hit the local junkyard after receiving their Tet shot....Yes, it's true if you live in the city or some close together suburban neighborhood, the kids may have a hard time finding the common resources for building these things BUT there is NO reason why as a PARENT/ADULT you can not get involved in the hunt. Instead of finding a way to entertain your kid without you ""having"" to be involved, man/woman up and play with your kids!! This book is full of great inspiration & motivation for kids & their parents to spend time together. If the kid has never experienced this way of play then surely you know not to hand them the wheel without some supervision. If you do not have tree branches, pruning's around in your yard then ask around the neighborhood when you see trees being cut.Ask Grandma/pa or other relatives & friends. Ask a local tree cutting service if you can have branches from trees they are cutting nearby {instead of these things being put through their chipper machine}.The writer encourages resourcefulness, imagination, problem solving & common sense. Kids learn through playing and this book will do just that. From figuring out on their own what can be used {this is where you the parent/adult can take the time to look the book over with them & discuss what they would like to build from the authors pages} all the way to how the items they found will fit/work out with what they envision. There are no measurements, per say, it's all about collecting the items needed and putting it all together which is powered within their minds by problem solving. Great pictures and illustrations for guidance but this is not a blueprint style of book. This style of learning is one of the most lacked & must have skills our children NEED to learn. Many thanks needs to go to the author for putting this book out there for encouraging kids to use skills much needed in their adult lives. Resourceful problem solving. The adult can shadow, being their mind of reason with suggestions and encouragement but do not become so deeply involved the kids are not the main players. Build your own fort! :)Although I did not buy this book {yet! & surely will as a permanent piece of the kids home library}, I picked a copy up at the public library for some winter dreaming by the fire with my kids. My son & I looked it over, searching for which one he would like to build in the Spring with his sisters. We discussed where they might find such items for the fort designs he liked. He was won over by the stick/tree branch debri square fort, using a wattle weave for the walls. Kids learn that weave in school with paper projects so he knew by relating to the school project, how to wattle the walls. In this day & age where kids are rarely with the power of resourceful imagination due to the whole ""sanitary & safety"" hype, I was frustrated by lack of variety in books that do encourage & SPARK a kid to use their brains for resourceful problem solving with outdoor fun. This book provides that spark PLUS is a great way to get adults OUT OF THE HOUSE and playing with their kids. As a kid my brothers & I were left to roam the woods and neighborhood without supervision {it was the 80's!}, unlike children now who are locked behind fences & indoors with factory made electronic devices sapping up their childhood. Get over what the neighbors will think about you collecting & having tree branches laying around in the yard or collecting them.The bonus to their fort building is now what to put inside of it! A table made from a log? Planting some Mint or penny-royal around the edges to help keep bugs at bay? How about coming up with a club sign or sewing up a Fort flag?! This book can be the beginning to many great fun filled days. A domino effect, bubbling up the sparkle of imagination and happy times.
Summary 2: Nice concept but after reading it, these were all forts we built as kids. Granted it's been awhile, I'd rather check a book like this out from the library as it was mostly a memory trigger. I'll keep the book for our two boys (1&3) but they'll out imagine it by age 6 I'm guessing.
Summary 3: I bought this book thinking how cool it would be for an 8-year-old nephew. But I am blown away by the number of ways a kid could get hurt or even killed by following the advice in this book. After a very brief and largely useless &quot;safety first&quot; warning, the author goes on to suggest such things as snow forts that use car hoods and other heavy objects as the roof -- with snow packed on top, no less. If the kid isn't crushed or suffocated in his nifty new fort, he probably will die of lock-jaw from the cut he gets on the rusty edge of the car hood -- or from the old windows that the author suggests are the perfect thing for lean-to forts. Does this guy live next to a junk yard? There are several cool ideas in the book, but none that a kid probably couldn't come up with on his own -- especially if mom and dad say, &quot;Yeah, go ahead. Anything and everything you can find to drag into the backyard is ok with us.&quot; Several of the tee-pee/wigwam forts are just fine if a kid is in the woods with lots of deadfall. Otherwise, the environment is going to take a hit -- as are the $180 trees that the neighbors just planted last spring. Which is nothing compared to the hospital bill you'll have for the 19 stitches required to close up the gash from the suggested use of a scythe or weed cutter to &quot;gather handfuls of grass or hay no shorter than 15 inches.&quot; Send 'em over to my yard; my lawn needs mowing. Seriously, folks. This book should be recalled."
0806966076,Painting Fabulous Floorcloths,"Summary 1: I found this book very informative. Being new to making floorcloths it gave me all the information I needed. It didn't just skim over the subject but dealt with it in depth.
Summary 2: Lots of ideas in this book. Now a favorite. Received in excellent condition well within the time limit.
Summary 3: This book showed many different floor clothes. Great for starting a class. It gave the kids many different ideas."
0595234518,Body Self: take ACTION in your quest for Positive Body Image & More Self-Confidence,"Summary 1: I also read this book when it was first available last year as an e-book, and I definitely found it inspiring. Body image + sexuality are inextricably linked, and I found Miss Dodd's personal accounts of her struggles to be fascinating and ultimately inspirational. Buy this book for your teenage daughter!
Summary 2: I just want to say thank you to those of you who have posted reviews on here. After reading them I feel ready to read this inspiring book. I have been overweight all my life, and battled with self esteem issues for the majority of my adolescence. I must say to the people who have self-esteem issues who are not overweight, or haven't had an eating disorder...even though you find it hard to find something that reaches out to you, there are some good books that deal strictly with self-esteem and confidence issues. You must look within yourself to find out what it truly is that upsets you about yourself...is it your body, or is it that you feel inadequate in another way? Perhaps when you do that, you will realize that you are not unhappy with your body, but rather with another aspect of your life/personality. For the women who have weight issues, feel unattractive--we have many issues facing us. We have been labeled for the majority of our lives, and our issues have always been hidden...trying to avoid attention and finally we have resources that can help us deal with the emotional damage our weight and self confidence issues have caused.I'm looking forward to reading this book. I hope that it can help me heal my emotional pain caused by weight, food, and feeling unattractive.
Summary 3: There are very few books that I recommend to other readers, because I assume that everyone has their own tastes and their interests -- especially in the area of ""self-help."" But, this book covers such a far reaching subject, and I think just about every woman I know could benefit from it. This woman talks about body image in regards to sex, dressing, jobs, long term success, even friendships.It really is inspirational, and it changed the way I looked at my waist, hips, thighs, butt, you name it!"
0787953563,Mediating Dangerously: The Frontiers of Conflict Resolution,"Summary 1: This is a passionate, in-your-face plea for exploring the difficult process of transformational mediation, truly digging into the roots, the skin, the pores of people's, group's and organization's conflicts (although Cloke denies being a wholehearted transformational mediation believer).Cloke is the highly respected author of numerous books on conflict resolution and the director of the Center for Dispute Resolution in Santa Monica, Calif. He has a very fine sense of the nature of conflict, in all its rough-and-tumble, down-and-dirty depth and breadth. Cloke deftly and deeply explores the psychological, emotional and spiritual nature of conflict within each of us - an important facet of mediation.But sometimes, in his very exploration of these matters, he overreaches in his hopes of what mediation can accomplish. Certainly, in the confines of community mediation, even generally with only few participants involved, there is just so much of transformational mediation, of this deep personal examination that one can accomplish in basically a two-hour time period, the general length of most community mediations, at least in most of the United States, I believe.I find Cloke veering toward encouraging counseling and psychotherapy as part of meditation. Mediators are rarely trained in these and other similar fields and should tread lightly when going beyond their skill level and the parameters of mediation itself. In other forms of more in-depth and complex mediation, these possibilities might be explored, but in community mediation, it hardly seems likely or even possible.Cloke does come up with some astute observations. He says to not be afraid of conflict, which obviously can become tense and heated. This is very important, especially in Minnesota (where I've been a community mediator for 19 years), where people are frequently afraid of confrontation, of raising of the voice, where, from my understanding, the introductory comments of Minneapolis Mediation Program mediators are suppose to include saying basically that the participants should not raise their voice and not get confrontational, something I have never been comfortable saying, and something I as a mediator rarely do indeed mention.He gives an outstanding list of questions mediators can use in exploring conflicts (pages 37-38), citing a specific case of bullying. Mediation absolutely benefits from deep and clear thinking, and this series of questions is an excellent example of how a mediator can explore participants' conflicts in a very thoughtful and crucial way. This is a very valuable exploration.Cloke does a very good job of telling and showing how to become a better, more insightful mediator, a more self-examined mediator and person.Sometimes, however, Cloke can have his head in the clouds in his hopes and dreams of what mediation can be. On page 47 he mentions ""...moving conflicts beyond settlement and resolution, beyond resolution to personal and organizational transformation, and beyond transformation to transcendence"" (page 47). Whew! Made me feel like I was at an EST seminar and what exactly was he smoking? But better to have a grand vision and greater reach than to have a small and puny mind. No one could accuse Ken Cloke of that.He spends pages trying to define ""spirit"" and gets nowhere. He is just too New Agey in this and some other regards.Still, there is much valuable and thought-provoking material in this first half of the book, entitled ""The Inner Frontiers.""The book's second half, ""The Outer Frontiers,"" is less successful, discussing the larger issues of overcoming fascism and racism, building community, the limits of law, transforming institutional systems, etc. His plea for an issues-based thought process is delightful, and when we can convince dictators and warring tribes about this the world will be a better place. But hey, put out the ideas. Dream. Here some readers will find Cloke a visionary, others a dreamer. I lean toward the latter but admire his reach. I feel Cloke has little here that can be of use to a mediator. But if schools, businesses, government bodies and so on can use this kind of thinking and make some inroads on change and growth, wonderful.He does make a bold plea for the value of mediating domestic abuse, something mediation, in my opinion, correctly has avoided. With all his arguments, he fails to make the most important one: the imbalance of power between the parties. An obvious omission.""Mediating Dangerously"" can be of significant benefit to both the beginner and experienced mediator, although the complexities Cloke often delves into are much more likely to be of value to an experienced mediator who can more relate to these situations from the very fact of having gone through them. Still, they can be a valuable learning experience for the new mediator.In spite of some flaws, ""Mediating Dangerously"" is a valuable resource.
Summary 2: This book connects conflict mediation with spiritual growth. I found it extremely insightful. Not always easy reading, it takes a bit of time to digest, but this man has a very deep knowledge of both conflicts and human consciousness. This book is a guideline to changing the way you behave when you have conflicts, or to help others that have conflicts. One of the best books I read in the past few years.
Summary 3: For anyone mediating, resolving conflicts, etc., this is an incredibly great book to read. I think he talks about the really ""deep"" essentials of being effective as a mediator and resolving conflicts."

And, of all things, this pup had a warm, dry nose.In his day people weren't dog lovers. In fact, they had absolutely no use for them. Dogs weren't allowed in their cabins: &quot;Sooner ask in their pigs.&quot; As if this weren't bad enough for Little Scraggly Hair the other dogs didn't like him either. He was unusual because he didn't chase cats; he rather liked them. All this little fellow knew was to run and hide because he was positive he'd always be chased off. Furthermore, he surely was hungry.Fortunately for Little Scraggly Hair he wandered into the yard of a man named Noah who was working very hard at building a boat. That was surprising as there wasn't any water nearby. Even more surprising was Noah's kindness - he was nice to the puppy and shared his dinner with him.The surprise in this endearing tale of friendship between a man and a puppy is how puppies developed cold wet noses.Children will find lots of smiles and a valuable lesson to learn in &quot;Little Scraggly Hair.&quot;- Gail Cooke
Summary 2: I'm partial to mutts - they always seem to be loyal and have a sweet disposition. This story is wonderful. I love the dialect, I love the transformation and I love the point of the story. Wonderful, wonderful!
Summary 3: I read this to my 6 year old daughter the first couple times and we both found it frustrating. It is written with a ""hillbilly"" dialect which was difficult for my daughter to understand. I found myself explaining the story after each line I read. We put the book on the shelf and she did not choose it for a bedtime story for months. When she pulled it out again, I decided to read it with that Southern accent, and have fun with it. Now, it's become one of her favorite bedtime stories."

Summary 3: Reviewed by Cherie Fisher for Reader Views (9/06)Author Amy C. Baker gets to the heart of the matter for working Christian women - how to integrate faith into everyday work. Ms. Baker has taken 20 years of professional experience in human relations, communications and not for profit and turned it into an easy to follow blueprint for Christian women to follow. Often using her own work experience as an executive for Dell, a hugely successful company, she shows the reader that a person does not have to compromise their values or excellence to succeed in business. Every chapter is full of solid career advice, values and some very humorous examples of successful people who use these principles. Baker ends each chapter with things to think about and evaluate in our own lives.The 7 lessons of Career Excellence include:Career Planning is your job - even if it's not in your job description. People need to take responsibility for their own careers and not leave it up to the Human Resources Department. You are the only person who really knows your skills and successes.Organizational politics exist in every company. Stories of political maneuvering go back to the Bible and will always exist. It is up to us to work with the highest ethics and Christian values when confronted with office politics.There's always a customer. Who are your customers? Do you have a good relationship with them? Would they describe you as ethical and honest?You are not defined by the title on your business card. So many people get caught up in the ego world of job titles and we are so much more than just a job title.Mentoring can be magical, but not manufactured. It is important to choose mentors who represent the values that you hold close to you.There's no such thing as too much integrity. Integrity covers much more than just work decisions, it is based on what and how we say it, gossip or inappropriate talk, and even our appearance.Your work impacts the Kingdom of God. Every person in the workforce impacts the Kingdom of God, from the frontline fast food associate to the President of a company.Baker uses successful stories from women throughout the book beginning with the foreward by Supermodel Kim Alexis. Here is a high profile woman who stands by her Christian values in the tough fashion world. Other examples include many high profile women who face tough decisions in the workplace everyday and choose the Christian way. They prove that you can be highly successful and not be swayed away from your beliefs.This is a book that I would highly recommend for Christian women going into or already in the workplace. Amy Baker does a great job integrating Christian principles and overall excellence with the career path. I would like to coin a phrase from her book where she describes successful women from Biblical Stories by saying ""You Go Girl!"" right back to her.Book received free of charge."
B0008BCCX4,The Century cook book,"Summary 1: As with all of these old books of ""receipts,"" 'The Century Cook Book' is chock-full of historical how-to's, from how to make coffee to budgeting for dinner (turkey at 16 cents a pound!). If you're a historical writer or just a history buff, you'll love this book. If you're looking for something more modern-day, give this book a look-see. The section on ""How to utilize what some cooks throw away"" does have relevance in today's kitchens, and ""Things to remember"" are truly that: I didn't know that ""A pinch of bi-carbonate of soda mixed with tomato before milk or cream is added prevents the milk from curdling."" Ah! Revelation! And then there's this: ""To skim sauces, draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, throw in a teaspoonful of cold water, and the grease will rise so that it can be easily taken off."" This book is wonderful from many perspectives; there is truly a little something in here for everyone. How to broil, how to braisse (a technique I've only recently discovered), how to put out a grease fire (still very relevant!), how to lard (hello, Julia Child!), how to make a roux (which any Cajun cook can do half asleep), how to make calf's head soup...OK, not so much. In all, the book is just fun and informative and an all-'round good read.
Summary 2: This is a very interesting cook book but very wordy. Good reading, though. If you want to know how people use to entertain or the rules to entertainment, read this book.
Summary 3: Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. I wouldn't recomment this book at this time for anyone serious about cooking.
Summary 4: It was interesting to read how our ancestors wrote out their recipes. Some of them were interesting I must admit. Some I can never see myself ever wanting to make much less eat.times and tastes certainly do change."
1890350001,"Catching the Thread: Sufism, Dreamwork, and Jungian Psychology","Summary 1: Another book on the great Nothingness and Oneness/God and Monism-and our realization of this and merging with it. The different methods this book used to capture the essence of Spirit were brilliant. Those would be: Sufism, Dreamwork, and Jungian Psychology. He writes about those archetypal characters that are within your own self, and the dark shadows that you have by which casted a veil between you and the Beloved. That is what is also key to this work, it describes the true Love that is God and that I know is the essence of our full existence and the Ultimate Reality. It is the ocean that is God, and any love that we experience in this life is a glimpse of the ocean of love which is Oneness. And any beauty here on Earth is a reflection of the infinite ocean of beauty that is Oneness. Our goal is to reach that by transforming our inner shadows. Now you might wonder how that archetypal plane is related to reaching Oneness, and that is through the other side of this book: dreamwork. Usually in describing monism and reaching God through the higher levels of reality, dreams are thought of as lower levels than what we experience now. But this author interprets them in light of our Self, which is One with realization of God. I must say that while reading this I felt more deeply suspended into that mystic Oneness.
Summary 2: The author uses many threads (Jung, Blake, Edinger, Jacobi, Mother Teresa, Esther Harding, Rumi, St. John of the Cross, etc.) to weave a simple, refreshing, mystical work. The Sufi exposure is a welcome addition for the Western reader in the journey along the alchemical path. The way of unity for seekers presents a challenge to those consciously pursuing the spiritual life.
Summary 3: Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for reading Catching the Thread. The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me. For those unfamiliar with Jungian psychology, this book serves as a useful introduction."
0878331395,The Texas Rangers: The Authorized History,"Summary 1: I've only been a Texas Rangers fan since 1994, and my wife gave me this book as a present in 1997. I knew the Texas Rangers existed before I came to live in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Texas area, but I never thought much of them. I didn't realize the characters and history of the team. If you're a casual Rangers fan, or a die hard Rangers fan, then you should have this book. It's filled with all kinds of informational pieces about the team's history, going back to the early 70's when they were the Washington Senators. Focuses heavily on the 1996 season in which they finally made it to the playoffs after about 25 years.As the Texas Rangers now move into the Alex Rodriguez era, the book probably could stand an update, as a lot has happened since the book was published during the 1997 season, but it's a great read if you're into team history.
Summary 2: Eric Nadel may be THE best baseball radio broadcaster in the country. His Page From Baseball's Past radio program is always interesting and this book follows the same pattern. A great book for the baseball fan and especially a Ranger fan
Summary 3: Eric Nadel, one of the most informative and entertaining radio broadcasters of his generation, paints a great portrait of Rangers' baseball and all of its oddities over 25 years. A must-read for any longtime Rangers' fan!
Summary 4: This book provides an excellent history into the Texas Rangers franchise, with plenty of great stories, color photos, statistics and commentary to help a reader learn all they need to know about the team. There is an emphasis on the 1996 season, as this was the Rangers' first ever playoff season, and the book brings back fond memories. Eric Nadel is the radio commentator for the Rangers, he does a great job with his broadcasts, and puts in terrific work with this book.I have been a Rangers fan since 1991, which much to my amazement, amounts to nearly 20 years. I was in school during the 1996 season, and though I no longer lived in Texas, I followed every Rangers move that I could. This was back before cable television offered baseball viewing packages, so I had to make due with only watching a few Rangers games each season, and listening to the rest by internet radio or other means. The 1996 season was a lot of fun and a real payoff for longtime fans.This book is broken up into sections, starting with the 1996 season, then going back to the beginning and moving forward chronologically with information on each season. Only when reading the full chronology does one develop a full appreciation at the futility that the Rangers went through before breaking through in 1996. The book closes with a section full of statistics for every Rangers player. It is an excellent ""coffee table"" reference book that you can pick up, read a portion, and then put back until you feel like looking something up or reading some more.It's been awhile since 1996, and I believe I read somewhere that Eric Nadel said he would consider doing an update to the book if the Rangers ever made the World Series. Well, after a miserable stretch in the 2000's, the Rangers finally look poised to contend again. If things go well, the Rangers may finally win a playoff series, and this book will have an update."
0761524185,"Walt Disney World with Kids, 2001 (Special-Interest Titles)","Summary 1: Since we take so few vacations, I like to make sure they're planned well so everyone gets the most out of them. I bought 3 Disney books (Unofficial Guide by Sehlinger and Birnbaum's 2001 edition too) but this is the one I found most useful for planning a trip with a 4 &amp; 6 year-old. The tips saved us $1000 on room costs alone! The reviews of the Disney and off-site hotels offer useful details not found on websites. The excellent ride reviews feature details to help parents determine if it's too scary for your child (tells you if dark, noisy, surprise elements, etc) - not just a generic &quot;may scare children under age 5&quot; warning. The book is fun &amp; easy to read... and with her realistic advice for visiting Disney with kids, you'll have more fun and be less stressed-out on vacation than if you did it without her book.
Summary 2: We used this for many months before our vacation last year. It was almost drenched with highlighter markings long before we left for Florida. When we got there, it was like our Bible as we toured the parks. It has everything you need to know for Disney and beyond. Her sense of humor is most amusing and she does let you know where to eat without losing your mind or cookies with toddler in tow. So buy it and then keep it, because you will write notes in it and after your trip it will become almost a souvenir of sorts with all your little articles and receipts etc, tucked away in side. You will look through it a year or two later and laugh at your comments about whatever you were thinking at the time. We had teenagers and toddler and everything worked out great, she has some real tips that do everyone good, not just the kids. Mom and dad won't lose their mind trying to please everyone. We are heading to Universal as well this year, so we will definitely be buying her Universal book.
Summary 3: I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read &quot;coming in 2000&quot; and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money.
Summary 4: We were looking for a book with information about the Disney Crusie Line with children. We are taking our daughters (9 and 13) on the Disney Wonder in February 2001, and we were looking for some insight that our travel agent couldn't give us. This book explained everything from check in at our Disney Resort to boarding the ship....it also explained all the activities available for our children and the dining schedules. I definately recommend this book to anyone who is looking for the same information that we were looking for!! (or any information on Disney with kids!!!)"
0451198689,Thunder Heart,"Summary 1: I started reading Cassie Edwards books this yr. I was into the Harlquin Super Romance Books and believe me, I havent picked one of the HSR books up since I first read this book. I have since got my mother and my best friend reading these books also. We swap books so often and everytime we see a new book by Cassie we grab it. She is an excellant write that I would not mind meeting and telling her in person that her books have touched me and my family. My love for my husband even grew stronger by the love the Indians show. I am working on my heritage (Cherokee) as we speak. Keep up the great work Cassie
Summary 2: The characters in this book have backgrounds which influence them as the story unfolds. I especially found it interesting to see life as a captive from a child's point of view throughout the story since Dede's son was held captive along with her. I found the ending of the story to be very touching (warm fuzzies). Read it and you'll know what I mean.
Summary 3: 1877 - South Dakota to MissouriCassie Edwards' love for Indian romances is very apparent! I get the impression her heart and soul is poured into each romance she writes. THUNDER HEART like her others, is a revealing, honest, and romantic look at Indian history.Thunder Heart's band has been named Musti-Ponca (Warm Ponca) because the white man has moved his tribe to Missouri. On the trip his loss was tremendous, and now as they sit and wait on the white man, his chieftain father and his people are ill. Dede and her son Johnny first learn of the Ponca's existents when they hear the haunting songs of the tribe. Bill who lives with Dede in name only is out to seek revenge on the Indians for his painful loss. As he and others make destructive plans against Thunder Heart's tribe, Dede makes plans of her own.Ms. Edwards paints the canvas of her romance with some colorful characters, interesting historical facts, and a steamy romantic moment or two."
1564762742,Dance of Darkness (Winds of Light #8),"Summary 1: My mother brought the first book of the series with us as reading material on a 4 week holiday in Scotland. I imediatly fell in love with it and upon returning to Canada devoured the series. They are incredibly exciting and the series as a whole is a must read. I recommend them to anyone who wants a good plot at an easy writing level.
Summary 2: This is a great book, but I wish the Winds of Light Series would be combined into a single novel and availible.
Summary 3: I like these books a lot! I wish some were not out of print!"
B0006P2T4E,The complete guide to medicine ball training,"Summary 1: Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore.
Summary 2: the book was very informative and showed me some new exercises with the ball. I use the ball quite frequently and I have learned some new moves with the book. thanks for a well informative book!Antonio
Summary 3: great resource for anyone looking to add variety to medicine ball exercises, increase their overall explosiveness during intense physical activity.
Summary 4: Very basic . More challenging and rewarding exercises not covered . Many routines designed to be done with a partner than alone"
0786268948,Steam: The Untold Story Of America's First Great Invention,"Summary 1: Sutcliffe really does tell a compelling story about ""America's first great invention"" which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been adequately told until now. Most of us learned early in life that Robert Fulton invented the first steam-powered boat, just as we were also told in school that Thomas Edison invented almost everything else, including the light bulb. In fact, James Rumsey and John Fitch competed strenuously to be the first to launch a steam-powered boat. During the summer of 1790, Fitch launched a steamboat commuter service between Philadelphia and Trenton but was unable to make it profitable in competition with stagecoaches. It was not until almost 20 years later (1807) that Fulton's Clermont carried passengers between New York City and Albany.The need for water transportation was obvious, hence the importance of barges but they could not proceed against the current and had to be towed back or returned over land for their next voyage. What if the power of steam could be used to solve that problem? Of course, those whose economic self-interests would be threatened by (in effect) a steam-powered barge -- notably owners and employees of stagecoach and barge companies -- did all they could to oppose efforts by Rumsey and Fitch. They delayed but could not ultimately deny what proved to be the inevitable commercial success of steam-powered boats, ""America's first great invention.""Sutcliffe's writing skills are such that her presentation of historical material reads like a novel worthy of Charles Dickens in his prime. Her narrative has everything: passionate and determined antagonists, a plot filled with crisis and conflict, conspiracies, use and abuse of political influence as well as all manner of anecdotes which help to reveal the stresses, tensions, and (yes) opportunities which developed during the years immediately following the American Revolution.Great stuff!
Summary 2: When Isaac Newton was being congratulated for his schentific achievements he said, ""If I have accomplished anything it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants who went before me.""When Robert Fulton produced a steam boat he took all the credit and got away with it. His achievements were great, but only because a bunch of inventors went before him. He too stood on the shoulders of giants, he just didn't admit it.Andrea Sutcliffe has done a good job here of pulling together the history of the development of steam powered vessels in the United States.She mentions that Henry Miller Shreve (after whom Shreveport, Louisiana was named) built some steam boats. I tend to say that the thing Robert Fulton built was really a steam ship, that is a deep draft vessel, suitable for use in deep rivers like you find in the Northeast. Shreve invented (along with some help of course) the typical Mississippi River Steamboat.This is probably not important, but when we think of the early boats, we tend to think of riverboats on the Mississippi not the early boats on the Hudson.Recommended book.
Summary 3: In school, we learned to say ""Robert Fulton"" whenever we were asked to name the inventor of the steamship. Alas, not only is that answer wrong; but a correct one cannot be summed up by just one name, one year, or one event. Andrea Sutcliffe unravels the tangled web of men, machines, failures, successes, financial backers, patents and politics involved in getting steamships chugging on American rivers during the time period of 1784 to 1811. Here we learn about people like John Fitch and James Rumsey. We discover how George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were involved in the process. We read about boiler explosions, innumerable tinkerings and improvements, and proving ""who had what idea when."" The newly-formed Patent Office plays a huge role in this drama. Robert Fulton doesn't even make an appearance until the last third of the book. Throughout it all, one has to wonder about the tenacity and sanity of the men who not only had to deal with the temperament of machines, but also with the skepticism of state and federal authorities. Imagine attempting to take a prototype steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers during the New Madrid earthquake of 1811! Why didn't we ever hear about these stories in school? As for Robert Fulton: ""As Fulton freely admitted, he never really invented the steamboat. Rather, he built the first steamboat that really worked."" (p. 180) And he comes off as a dandy and an opportunist in this book.You might scoff and ask, ""How interesting can the history of the steamboat be?"" Read this book and find out. The miracle is that this invention ever came to fruition.
Summary 4: ""Steam"" captures the intrigue of the chase for steam-powered transportation. And there was no shortage of intrigue and industrial espionage when it came to building the first American steamboat. Ms. Sutcliffe also develops the novelty of steam power in the 18th century and what a radical departure the steam engine was compared to water power.The story of the steam engine also involves politics. Inventors sought patents in order to make claims for navigation monopolies. The inventors knew that inventing a steam boat would not make them rich. However, a monopoly to operate a steamboat on a particular river would be their path to wealth. (The story of Robert Fulton.)Ms. Sutcliffe takes care to present a balanced storyline. In most histories of the steamboat, the authors tended to be partial to a particular inventor. This is not the case with this work.""Steam"" is an American story, but it also is a global story with James Watt's steam engine setting the standard for the era. America had to invent a steam engine because Great Britain guarded the technology and export licenses of the Watt engine.I found it quite remarkable that inventors James Rumsey and John Fitch built operational steamboats with almost no information to go on. And certainly, they had no working model (like Watt's engine) to copy. These boats were built a full decade before Eli Whitney introduced the concept of machined, interchangeable parts.Ms. Sutcliffe has done her readers a favor by presenting her work as a chapter of American history rather than as a technology primer. The age of steam in America begins just after the end of the Revolutionary War. We find a fledgling American nation still joined at the hip with Great Britain. And we see the battle between states and the federal government for power to issue patents and navigation franchises.The story of the steamboat makes for a good barometer of the first four decades of American history."
B000J0WANQ,Bobby Kennedy : The Making of a Folk Hero,"Summary 1: I have read many books about Robert Kennedy in the past 20+ years and found this book to be one of the most personal and enjoyable biographies of Bobby. The author has access to many papers and people not previously quoted. While other books take more of a historical look at Bobby, this book is more personal. The reader will feel as if they know Bobby, which makes the ending all the more painful. It was a fairly quick read because I could hardly put the book down.
Summary 2: Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child. He was certainly the man for everyone; he was the voice of many.This delightful book provides some personal insights regarding the man's character and political make up. Personal quotes from letters, documents and people who knew him create a strong sense of the man he was.It is a shame this book is out of print because it would be such a welcome addition to any library of Robert Kennedy. The author not only treats him with respect; he views him with an affectionate eye and an almost sympathetic awe.Robert Kennedy was indeed an awe-inspiring person. Diligence was a trait that marked him his entire life. Mildly dyslexic as a boy, he would, by adult life become well versed in classic literature. Acrophobic his entire life, he would, in 1965 climb a previously unscaled mountain in Canada with two professional climbers out of love for his slain brother, the late President. This single act is very inspirational because he tabled his biggest fear and was able to act out of love. From all accounts, this man felt displaced among his older, more outgoing siblings. His was the classic &quot;shouting to be heard&quot; story. In adult life, his voice would become the voice of many; his voice would be one readily and eagerly listened to and taken very seriously.His untimely death in 1968 leaves a painful void in history; one can never help wondering what this at core good, committed and compassionate and very driven man would have accomplished had he won the 1968 Presidential Election.
Summary 3: ""Bobby Kennedy The Making of a Folk Hero"" is a very well-written biography on RFK. Endless speculation abounds over what might have happened during the 1960s-1970s had he been elected. We may never know, but the reader can know more about his life in this great biography.Among the points covered include:1. Early life and relationship with father, mother, brothers, and other family members (he was obviously very loyal to them).2. Search for meaning in life and aimlessness of his early years.3. Experiences as Attorney General, Attorney, Presidential Candidate, and other roles.4. Involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, especially when James Meredith was the first black student accepted at the University of Mississippi.5. Campaigning for President.The narrative flows freely and you can really get a sense of what Bobby was feeling in certain events (JFK's assassination, Martin Luther King, James Meredith, Bay of Pigs, JFK's campaigns, etc.).A great read on a person who could have really been used to change America (some say for the better, others say for the worse).Highly recommended."
1930865112,The Transfer Society: Economic Expenditures on Transfer Activity,"Summary 1: When the government robs Peter in order to pay Paul, they have to pay for the entire process of robbing: constructing laws, buying the guns, hiring more bureaucrats, etc. In other words, when government spends funds to redistribute income, they divert resources that could be used on more productive activities.&quot;The Transfer Society&quot; is a slim but marvelous study on how much the government spends each year on enforcing the coercive transfer of money from one party to another. You may think that these forced transfers do not cost very much money -- and if one takes each transfer at a time, he may be right. But taken as a whole, multiplied by the government's long reaching tenacles, they estimate that the government spends $400B redistributing.But if that was not enough, Laband and McClintock go on to demosntrate that this projected $400B is in reality an understatement; they cannot estimate the preemptive measures taken by individuals to protect their property from the government. For example, if the government used eminent domain to seize somebody's land, L&amp;M's model would not account for the costs of one hiring a lawyer to protect himself from coercive government. Forced transfers, thus, waste a staggering amount of money that would be better used in productive activity.This book is a timely economic complement to the moral argument against forced expropriation. The magnitude of the problem is exposed so convincingly that it should become a focus of attention for quite some time.
Summary 2: This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer.
Summary 3: How much time, money and resources have been allotted to influence how wealth is distributed in this country? Over $2,000 year for every individual, according to this title. The figure doesn't represent the amount transferred, but the amount spent on influencing transfers. Transfer Society provides a refreshingly different perspective on new wealth and the process of distributing wealth within the government and private sectors. Intriguing and different."
1890951633,Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices of the Rwandan Genocide,"Summary 1: Not as well known as some of his contemporaries, Robert Lyons deserves a wider audience. Having previously published two other books on Africa, with Intimate Enemy he has published his most mature work. Composed of mostly square format black and white portraits, the book is spare simple and without judgement.. It shows again how the larger forces of history and politics can make the best of people do the worst of things. Not an easy book to look at but well worth having.
Summary 2: Robert Lyons and Scott Straus, Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices from the Rwandan Genocide (Zone, 2006)By now, pretty much every one is aware of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, almost invisible while it was going on but the subject of a great deal of media exposure since. As with all such things, though, there's always another angle from which to approach it. Robert Lyons and Scott Straus find one (two, actually) with Intimate Enemy; show the genocide from the point of view of those who participated (in Lyons' case), or from every point of view there is to be had in Rwanda (in Straus').After two introductions in which the author and photographer explain their methodologies in collecting the material presented here, we get into the edited transcripts of a number of interviews Lyons did with genocidaires-- those convicted of genocidal behavior who freely confessed to their crimes. Simply put, they're fascinating. Reading them, one has to wonder how much of what's said needs to be taken with how much salt; there's a lot of language that sounds suspiciously like ""I was only following orders,"" but with a dash of ""if I hadn't, I'd have been just as dead"" added to it. Straus' photographs, presented with no context whatsoever (notes on the photos are presented in a separate section afterwards), are even more intriguing, since he juxtaposes mass murderers with innocent bystanders, judges, victims' families. (Despite what you read in some of the interviews, you won't be able to tell them apart.)Thought-provoking. Recommended. ***
Summary 3: This very illuminating book shows us, through the descriptions of participants, what it was like during the Rwanda genocide. Photographic portraits made later show us other participants. Together they make a picture of yet another holocaust.The analysis of political scientist Scott Straus and the photographs of Robert Lyons exemplify the belief that objectivity is the key to understanding human affairs, social science. With it there is the hope that dispassionate, systematic analysis, like in the physical sciences, will provide understanding of and divergence from the destructive courses of the past. Straus uses the random sample; Lyons the straight-on shot. By striping away context, there is the promise that essences will be revealed. If Straus and Lyons had been able to observe the killings, instead of asking questions third hand, instead of photographing after the fact, would we better understand why people kill people? Terrorist videos with their fixed focus views are the closest we have to being present at horror. Yet when that wildly passionate, unprofessional radio announcer at the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937 says ""This is terrible', we understand. But what kind of understanding is that?Bill Arnold BA political science, MFA photography"
1557423784,Aaron's Rod,"Summary 1: Aaron Sisson, a coal miner and amateur flutist in the Midlands, abandons his wife and two children and escapes to Italy in the hope of throwing off the trammels of his environment and realising his individual potentials. His dream is to become recognised as a master flutist. In Florence, he mixes in intellectual and artistic circles and has an affair with an aristocratic lady who redeems him in his own eyes. Like the majority of Lawrence's novels, the central theme is the relations between men and women, though this time, it is given a twist owing to Lawrence nourishing his mind on a reading of Nietzsche, who was then gradually becoming recognised in England. In his analysis of the concept of &quot;love&quot; between the sexes, Lawrence perceives it as a function of the will to power, a cycle of reciprocal domination and surrender, in which the man must conquer and the woman must submit. Elements of the rejection of the &quot;herd morality&quot; on Aaron's part and his endeavour at self-development are both ideas of peculiarly Nietzschean provenance. The fact that Aaron realises himself through music is another echo of Nietzsche, who regarded music as the purest and most supreme of the arts, in which the passions achieve immense gratification. The title refers to the rod of Aaron in the Old Testament, one of Moses's renegade priests who built the golden calf in the desert for the worship of the Israelites. The rod, his symbol of authority and independence, finds its echo in Aaron's flute, which is broken later in the novel during an anarchist riot. There is a price to pay, Lawrence seems to imply, for daring to oppose orthodoxy and to try to create a new life for oneself. Unlike Lawrence's more famous works, such as &quot;Lady Chatterly's Lover&quot; and &quot;Women in Love&quot;, which are both admirable for their rich, poetic prose, &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot; is drably written and occasionally tedious, with a narrative that is sometimes poorly connected, as it dwells on irrelevancies. However, the message, that of an individual fulfilling his duty to himself, is an encouraging and refreshing one.
Summary 2: Strangely, this was my first full-length D.H. Lawrence novel. Thankfully, I'd read enough of his short stories and essays to know that Aaron's Rod isn't indicative of his artistic capabilities. I was more impressed by the concept behind the novel than its execution. Essentially, Aaron Sisson's abandonment of his family and job in order to join a travelling orchestra is meant to symbolize the power and passion of &quot;individual freedom,&quot; &quot;personal friendship&quot;, &quot;masculinity&quot; and &quot;art&quot;. I think he only half-succeeds. Just as Aaron comes across as an &quot;incomplete&quot; man searching for meaning in post World War I Europe, I think the novel is too loosely constructed, and Lawrence's characters, too thinly drawn. But on a symbolic level, they are full of Lawrentian psychology. The characters of Rawden Lilly, Struthers, the Bricknells, and others all overtly represent various aspects of male and female polarities; however, they are un-memorable and sometimes difficult to relate to.I was hoping this would be more of an &quot;artist's novel&quot; containing interesting descriptions of Aaron's life in Florence with his bohemian friends, and to a certain extent it is, but Lawrence seemed more interested in symbolism than in telling a good story. Though scattered as a story, the concepts of individuality and society are clearly portrayed throughout &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot;, and towards the end, when the anarchist's bomb goes off, we sense a &quot;breaking&quot; (the blue ball/ornament at the beginning, and the flute/rod at the end) of an outdated mode of thinking (i.e. patriarchy, male dominance, etc.) in favor not necessarily of feminity, but an integration of the two. This particular Penguin edition has an excellent introduction and helpful end-notes by Steven Vine which help explain Lawrence and his symbolism to those unfamiliar with his works. I might re-read this novel once I've read more of Lawrence, and come back to it one day from a different viewpoint, but for now, I'd have to say that unless you're a real Lawrence afficionado, I'd hold off on this one until you figure out whether or not you like Lawrence enough to proceed to something as scattered, cold, and dry as this novel comes across.
Summary 3: With almost two dozen typos per page this version of Aron's Rod was completely unreadable. Not just typos but many of the sentences were incomplete. I found out to my frustration that it was too late to return the book. In frustration I simply threw the book away. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PUBLISHER. I wish someone would have warned me about this.
Summary 4: I'm not going to waste anyone's time by spouting the virtues of this book, other than it is one of those that gets better with each successive read and only makes you want to know more about Lawrence, since a lot of it is autobiographical. It's a very philisophical, thoughtful, reflective book, not heavy on plot. It might really be insubstantial if not for the quality of Lawrence's prose.Now, for this Public Domain edition (at a not so bargain price). Mmmmmm, let's see...about 12 missing pages (that's right, completely missing), pages that look like they were copied by a 3 year old, or an 87 year old lush librarian --- smudgy, misshapen words, etc. Hey, I know this work is in the public domain....that's no excuse to grab some piece of deteriorating crap off the shelf, copy it and then attempt to profit by duping people that what they're getting is a quality product.It's not like there aren't better, complete versions out there...THEY'RE ON THE WEB!!!This edition is lazy, a travesty, and should be banned from being sold by Amazon as fradulent advertising.
Summary 5: &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot; was a very elequently written book combining both powerful imagery along with a keen sense of imagination. The majority of D.H. Lawrence's books' are written in much the same style. 'Tis unfortunate that the written word of his day is not as visible in ours."
0975533118,Beauty & Submission,"Summary 1: Written by one of America's hottest contemporary erotica writers the author takes us on a real life tour of her private world of sex slaves, swinging and BDSM. In contrast to most readers pre conceived notions where the `sadism' part of BDSM lifestyle is usually a description of a master beating the living daylights out of his slave, Maria Isabel Pita describes her relationship with her master as a pretty well wholesome practice of living out her fantasies ......Yes there are rules and considerations to a good relationship and the results can only be understated as very very satisfying. Being a master erotica writer the author manages to describe her life in a manner that takes the reader on a delicious and vicarious trip into a world that generally are only deep and hidden fantasies of most women ....This real life exploration of a sex slave/master relationship make these fantasies not only seem more plausible but also delicious .....
Summary 2: What struck me the most all throughout the reading of ""Beauty and submission"" is the power and bravery behind Maria Pita's prose. She is undoubtedly a wise old soul. Yet, in the same instance, her no-holds-barred honesty about the lifestyle and personal odyssey with her beloved Dom has a youthful innocence that refreshes and renews like rain in the springtime. Love is new, and forever renewed, by each other. Life obstacles faced by most vanilla lovers face are present along with the countless obstacles any alternative lifestyle will bring. Every such mountain is a challenge scaled with intelligent and triumphant results. Missa's enormous heart, and huge capacity to love and submit to her man in the purest sense, will stay with me (and I'm sure all her readers) long after this book is closed. This real life romance makes fictional renditions pale in comparison.
Summary 3: Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues).
Summary 4: I think one's like or dislike of this book will be largely dependant on whether or not he or she is into The Lifestyle. And even then- they are going to have be very open minded and refrain from judgment, as everyone's idea of what is ""normal"" varies so much. That's a hard thing to do, considering the blatant contradictions between the author's actions and her view of herself. This book also seems like a feeble attempt to make more money off of the original, and a way to promote her other novels. A lot of the manuscript is just excerpts from her other books!However, I did finish the whole thing in about 4 days. It IS a page turner- even though my respect for the author diminished considerably with each passing chapter. Again- it's a matter of preference. She wants to ""dispel negative stereotypes"", but personally I felt even more afraid of delving into anything beyond vanilla after reading it, and more unwilling to ever be associated with anyone of that nature. If a man wanted me to drink his urine and give me enemas and do it all in the name of love- I'd have a problem with it. Again, I'm not judging. Whatever two consenting adults do together is fine with me. Just don't try to pass it off as normal, and don't pretend to be strong when you aren't.
Summary 5: I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she ""quoted"" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy. It felt like an attempt to sell her other books."
1932613099,PE Sample Questions and Solutions: Chemical Engineering,"Summary 1: This sample test provides the look and feel of the actual PE exam.Amazon, I love your company, but your price can't compete in this case (almost $200 as I write this). I purchased this same book on the NCEES website for a small fraction of the price you charge here (around $40 plus shipping).
Summary 2: I recommend using this as a timed test in your preparations for the PE. I had the PE earlier today and these problems are inline with the difficulty you can expect. Some of the other practice exam are way too difficult.
Summary 3: Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. This sample exam is based on the old format that was used until October 2010. The problems are still helpful when practicing for the exam, but this book has no longer the same ""look and feel"" as the new exam. NCEES has a new sample exam book out that matches the new exam specifications and can be ordered from the NCEES website.
Summary 4: $200 for a book that can be purchased for $40 at the NCEES website? is this a bad joke from Rip-off-mazon?"
B000IMS3LI,The Deluge Drivers,"Summary 1: This was the final book in this trilogy, and I enjoyed it as much as the rest. It kept my interest through the whole series. Foster gripped me in the drama of the Ice world I came to admire in the first two books, only now the entire planet was now in serious danger. The ultimate global warming destroying the planet and miraculously being saved by rouge adventuring heroes kind of story. This series made me a Foster fan. If you enjoyed the Flinx series, you will really enjoy this one!
Summary 2: Prolific SF writer Alan Dean Foster wraps up the adventures of the stranded Ethan Fortune and Suka September on the ice planet of Tran-ky-ky in a nice little package for fans of the series. Turns out the thawing of the ice at the equator Ethan saw in the second book (Mission to Moulkin) was not natural at all, someone is actually attempting to thaw out the planet. That could mean possible extinction for the Tran, which is unexceptable to Fortune and September. They and their Tran friends head out on the Slanderscree to see that the process is stopped, permanently. A wonderful ending to a wonderful series, highly recommended.
Summary 3: I paid only 1 cent for this book and its worth it. I have been looking for it for over a year at the local used book stores with no luck so finally I checked here and within days of ordering I received it. It completes my collection and I can find out how the story ends now.
Summary 4: The finale of the Icerigger series does not have quite the adventure of the other two and harbors a pretty silly villain and plot. None-the-less, anyone reading Icerigger and Mission to Moulokin will have to read Deluge Drivers, if only to spend the last few minutes available with our new friends the Tran. There is definitely something wonderful and personal about this series. The characters are very rich and you really want to know more about them and share in their adventures."
9810237405,Algorithms: Design Techniques and Analysis (Lecture Notes Series on Computing),"Summary 1: The book represents a well written, consistent and easy to follow view on the area of algorithm analysis. It gives an excellent overview of various mathematical and computer science areas, including but not limited to combinatorial geometry, NP-problems, complexity theory, graph theory, algorithm analysis, dynamic programming and even computational geometry.Most of the chapters are intended for a senior level undergraduate and graduate student, but some (such as part 4 devoted to complexity problems) are more suitable for &quot;mature&quot; audience and require some preliminary knowledge in the area.I found chapters on sorting, data structures, recursion and functional programming well written and structured, and examples to be practical as well as informative.Sections on amortized analysis, randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms and iteration improvement deal with current directions in the algorithmic research and provide an excellent overview of the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; in these areas. I also enjoyed reading through the section on greedy algorithms (shortest path and minimum spanning tree problems).Section on computational complexity and analysis of the relationship between complexity classes seems to be a bit complicated, those who are interested in this area should probably do some preliminary reading.The last section on computational geometry (my area of expertise) and applications of Voronoi diagrams could be extended, but even in the current state it givs a pretty good idea of what computational geometry is all about.Overall, I give to this book a &quot;5 star&quot; review and recommend it for anyone who is seriously interested in learning exactly how algorithm design and analysis work. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and can only wish that author would write more books like that in the future!
Summary 2: This is a great book overall, but I give it 4 stars as it lacks the mathematical explanations that I personally was looking for. I am graduate student in Computer Science and a E-Commerce Consultant by profession. This book is more detailed than the Sedweick (I can't spell his name) in the sense that it has some more of a mathematical approach. It lacks the level of explanation that the Sedweick book provided. It has some math, but overlooks some steps thus targeting someone with a pretty solid math background, not someone with sophomore level undergraduate math background.Overall.. if you're a student taking an algorithms or advanced algorithms class (especially a graduate class), you might want to invest in this book.
Summary 3: I have studied both undergrad and grad algorithm courses from this book at KFUPM. For a beginner, the author provides a moderate level of mathematical analysis which helps in building a solid foundation, but avoids minor details that may obscure the overall grasp of the subject. The Exercise sets at the end of each chapter vary from easy to challenging...."
1556610734,Getting Evangelicals Saved,"Summary 1: Reidhead wonderfully shows that getting saved is not simply saying &quot;uh-huh&quot; to basic doctrinal questions. He exposes the plague that has come upon evangelical christianity.
Summary 2: I found this book by God's doing. Wasn't looking for it and wasn't familiar with the author. The title caught my attention. It is a must read for all Christians, and for allwho think they are Christian. This book may be out of print but if you can find it, it will well be worth your search for it. I recommend getting it into as many hands as you can.
Summary 3: I feel this is the best book I have read on biblical salvation. It is obvious that God is working on the sinner, but it is also very crucial that we know his order of operation. If you are looking for a book to help you examine your salvation or properly be used in Gods work this book is for you.
Summary 4: Getting Evangelicals Saved explains how and why the church is lukewarm. The fire from heaven - God in us - dwells not in the hearts of many, many professing Christians. They have not been born again thus they are not ""born of God"" John 1. Here's something radical, page 53 ""Please don't use John 3:16 with an unawakened sinner. Because, if you tell a sinner how to be saved, before he knows he needs to be saved, you only succeed in hardening him toward the gospel.""Mr. Reidhead deals thoroughly with the problem of many evangelical methods that give people the cure before they know they have a disease. They need to be awakened and this is clearly modeled by Jesus and Paul through the use of the law to show people that they have a desparate need for a Savior. (Rom. 7:7, Gal. 3:24) They're already guilty, but don't know it (yet). They must be woken up.Otherwise, they shrug and think they're a ""good person"" as they are comparing themselves to other people rather than holding up their lives to the standard of an infinitely Holy God and his law.But to address the subject of false converts is to rub up against the modern gospel which seeks to ""win souls"" through a life enhancement gospel. That if you sign up, you'll then have happiness. NO you won't. At least not the way the world defines it which is ""to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season"". Taking up the cross of Christ, to exchange your life for His, to walk in the way of righteousness is to partake of a grand paradox: give up your life, receive His life and get the promised persecution, trials and tribulations! Does that sound like God has a wonderful plan for our lives? In the book of Acts, Stephen didn't get that, Paul didn't hear that message before being brutally beaten. The cross is always painful and the Christian life brings true peace and joy and righteousness but the price is high - the price is everything. The Biblical way to express God's love to a sinner is to show him how great his sin is using the law and then give him the incredible grace of God in Christ.Getting Evangelicals Saved will help confused, bewildered Christians understand how the church has so strayed from the gospel according to the scriptures and teaches how to get back to applying what Jesus said and did about awakening sinners."
080507743X,Meet the Musicians: From Prodigies (or Not) to Pros,"Summary 1: As a child did you ever hear your mother call ""Time to come inside and practice?"" You were having a great time playing outdoors, doing really fun things with your friends, and now you have sit inside on a piano bench and play those durn scales.Or, as a parent have you been frustrated because your offspring won't take time to practice when you're paying good money for flute, violin or tuba lessons?Most of us have been in one of those situations or both. Now Amy Nathan, author of ""The Young Musician's survival Guide,"" gives us her latest book which proves we're not alone. ""Meet the Musicians"" is an upbeat, informative, up-close-and-personal look at 15 professional musicians all members of the New York Philharmonic. Many of them didn't like to practice when they were kids any more than we did. As adults and accomplished, disciplined musicians they offer excellent practice tips for both parents and children as well as sharing the paths they took to being part of a world class symphony orchestra.Beginning with Carter Brey, Cello and concluding with John Deak, Bass we find photos of these musicians as children, their favorite childhood activities, their educational backgrounds, the inside scoop on particular instruments, how they came to be members of the New York Philharmonic and brief biographical sketches.Young readers will easily relate to these musicians on many different levels.Violist Cynthia Phelps said, ""When I'm on stage, I think I'm the luckiest person in the world, having such a good time doing what I love to do."" She speaks for the musicians represented here, and perhaps for the musicians of tomorrow.Also included in ""Meet the Musicians"" is a helpful glossary and list of resources for those who wish to further pursue an interest in music.- Gail Cooke
Summary 2: This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional.
Summary 3: When you see an orchestra perform it look like the people in it play effortlessly. This is not the case. They get to be that great through LOTS of practice! In Meet the Musicians we are introduced to 15 member if the New York Philharmonic. They tell us there stories of how they found out they really wanted to be professionals.The book included a helpful glossary and a list of resources for learining.Young musicians will gain useful advise from the pro in this book."
0595366082,A History of Army Aviation: From Its Beginnings to the War on Terror,"Summary 1: The definitive history of Army Aviation from the beginning to present operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you like aviation history this is a wonderful resource. Should be in every library collection. A great gift for anyone interested in aviation.
Summary 2: This book covers a lot of ground, but suffers a bit from the sheer amount of detail. The organizational changes in Army Aviation are highlighted, and it is useful to know what organizational structures have been implemented at various times, but the cohesiveness of the story is often sidetracked. It is always a struggle to produce an exhaustive history while explaining how these details relate to the bigger picture, so I sympathize with the author.Unfortunately, it felt as though a large portion of the book was spent slogging through minutiae, and chronological progression was interspersed with thematic progression. I would give the content 4 stars, principally because the applications of aviation in particular engagements was given limited treatment, as were the advances in technology.I think that the best insight that I found in the book was the discussion of the particular difficulties encountered by the Army in providing for equivalent career development for soldiers in Aviation. In this regard, the author recounted the events as a continuing theme, and developed it into a cohesive story.I don't think that I could reconcile the desire to document all of the events covered in this book with a cohesive and engaging story without adding at least 50% to its length, so maybe that is the constraint that prevailed.The readability of the book makes it overall 3 stars in my opinion. As a reference, this book could be useful, but the astounding detail of the book makes the whole volume a giant index, and finding particular discussions requires knowing a priori where to look chronologically and thematically.
Summary 3: This book is a must read for ALL Army aviators. All you Warrant Officers will be surprised to find out that the Commissioned Officers did most of the flying in Vietnam."
1584651660,Massacre at Fort William Henry,"Summary 1: A good accounting of the state of affairs between England and France at that time. But still no really accurate accounting of the dead and wounded on either side.
Summary 2: Love the book..I was born 250 years too late..I would have liked to been there at the time...HOWEVER, massacre does not sound like it feels good ! lol
Summary 3: A little history about the novel & especially the movie,""Last of the Mohicans"" The book tells about the historythe the war they were fighting and the why about thehorrific massacre scene on the trail from Fort WilliamHenry in the movie."
080231273X,Dark Age Warrior,"Summary 1: In spite of the age of this work, and the fact it was directed to a young audience, it is well written and contains a great deal of useful information. Indeed, until very, very recently it was the ***only*** book that had any useful data on Dark Age warriors. Fortunately, more recent scholarship has come in to help fill the gap, but this is still a very useful work.Amazingly, it has not been reprinted with the rest of Oakeshott's series on Knights - why, I have no clue, for it is the best of the series that I have seen thus far, and is still extremely useful.Buy this if you can, which will not be easy unless a reprint is made - I lucked into a copy from Bookfinder and counted myself quite blessed.
Summary 2: While this is not one of his major books and written a long time ago Oakeshott got the details right according to what was known about the subject then, and it's a good introduction now decades later. I have his major books and most of the books written for young folks too. I read what others had to say about this book and I wasn't disappointed in it when I bought my own copy. It's a pleasant read and it filled a niche in our research books.Thirty years in reenactment societies...
Summary 3: This book is a paradox. It is written in a casual, conversational style yet it contains very scholarly information. Ostensibly aimed at a young adult or even younger audience it appeals just as well to adults. The main text runs about 105 pages with an appendix. It gives detailed information on the arms, armor and fighting style of the Germanic peoples that overran the Roman empire in Western Europe from around 400-800 A.D. It is the little details that really appealed to me, such as how the sword hilts were constructed, different makers marks on blades, and centers of manufacture. The excellent illustrations by the author compliment the text nicely as well. The author ended this study around 800 A.D. because that is when new metalworking technology changed the types of swords being made, thus beginning a new era in weaponry and swords in particular. I will definitely be reading more books by this author."
0833025147,In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age,"Summary 1: This book tackles international computer system threats that face nations and corporations head on. It presents a theoretical framework for action and will be a valuable resource for the next decade.Athena was also a serious topic in ancient times when she was the Greek god with a sword and shield, the one who thought up the first Trojan horse... a legacy that connects well with today's netwars.The authors of each chapter address different issues. Most are from the perspective of military issues. Many use clear historic perspectives to show how one side or the other lost conflicts, for example, the use of smart networks by Mongols to defeat Muslims and by Ho Chi Minh against Lyndon Johnson. Other examples are drawn from the gulf war; the chief of which is that the next opponent will likely not be as dumb as Saddam.Oddly there isn't much in the book about China and Russia, the cyber-bullies of today's world. Even if one did want to look up material on these countries the missing index prevents it. With a new abbreviation on every page it would also be helpful to have a Rosetta stone inside the back cover.The example of the wild west is used and very applicable here. There are only isolated pockets of law and order. Good and bad guys are hard to distinguish. Outside occasional enclaves good guys can only trust their resources and a few friends. This high level discussion can be directly translated to domains, firewalls, and virtual private networks. It argues against lowest-bidder security implementations.Computer network managers will understand diminishing role of government in the direction of commercial systems. This means less traditional compliance-driven security technology will be available. Corporate security, network administrators and infrastructure managers are out there on their own. &quot;Street smart&quot; information behavior will be necessary to survive.Through the book the term &quot;cyber&quot; is overused. It almost never appears in serious government discussions or commercial security where the emphasis is on all aspects of network issues.Security managers who want a superficial self improvement should skip this book. It is very concept-dense and filled with ideas which will cause the reader to stop and think about strategy. Few solution specifics are presented. Concepts in this book are suited for someone who is developing a strategic vision for protecting their organization from network attacks.[adapted from a review published in Security Management.

Summary 2: In Athena's Camp is, in my eyes, one of the most important books in the area of security policy at the given momnent, alongside 'Sources of Conflict', which has been published by Rand, too. I used the book in a term paper I wrote for political sciences, in which I examined the coming threats in context with the momentary policy of the german government (as I am German and studying here). The book was of utmost importance to me in this case, as it is, as far as I know, the only book covering this topic on such a high level of quality at the moment. Further research also revealed to me, that the momentary german policy is utmost abysmal, and that, surprisingly, the German Green Party, B&uuml;ndnis 90/ Die Gr&uuml;nen, would maintain the best policy in case of election (just for your information). To all students of political sciences worldwide who love researching the field of global and societal change through the information revolution, get it.
Summary 3: This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW.
Summary 4: This book may be a little old but the concepts are well thought out and totally relevant. It deals with the whole range of informational warfare issues. Some of which may not occur to the average reader. Be aware this is not for the casual reader."
0881336505,"The Choral Experience: Literature, Materials, and Methods","Summary 1: I teach Choral Music at a University, so every time the class comes back around that is to cover Conducting Technique as well as Choral Literature and Performance Style, I re-evaluate the available texts in case something better has come along. In several decades nothing has. In my mind it's still the one text that covers in a very basic way all the essential aspects of conducting choral music. It includes rehearsal techniques, gives voice instruction guidelines, and focuses on performance practice for each major style period in the western tradition. It even has diction charts for all the major choral languages. There are other excellent texts (which I also use in other courses) that cover a few areas of choral music-making in greater detail, but if you need one text to introduce students to the main topics in clear and authoritative language, this is still the one.
Summary 2: It won't make you a good choral conductor or teacher just by reading books. However, a solid groundwork is essential. This one book provides all the necessities, such as history, role &amp; responsibility, practice technique, basic musicianship and style guide for different repertoires.The authors treat the subjects in a no-nonsense way. For example, they didn't give you a long list of events on choral history, rather they blended them into the influencial parties and thus provide you insights on how the history evolved.So if you'd read only one book in choral literature, this is the one!
Summary 3: Great service! The book arrived in the condition that was given in the description."
B0006CAP6Q,Salvation,"Summary 1: This is hands down the best book on salvation ever. Lewis Sperry Chafer is one who teaches the true ""saved by grace through faith"" message. A must read, especially in todays world of so many different gospels being preached.
Summary 2: God has given Lewis Sperry Chafer a clear insite into the wounderful world of the Christian life. He clearly states the wonderful gifts God has so graceously given the Christian upon His Salvation.He very clearly states ""Who"" we are in Christ Jesus. Our ""Positons"" in Christ while here on this earth and in heaven. Totally Awesome book.A must have for any Christian.
Summary 3: This books explains in simple language God's gifts to us and His amazing love. An easy read with huge concepts.May it be a blessing to you as well.
Summary 4: Should you, reader of this book, be uncertain of your salvation, or know that you are not saved, will you not respond to the loving invitation of your God and come to Him by the way He has provided in the Person and cross of His Son? Think not that He expects anything from you but your whole trust in Him until He has first saved you by His grace. He will faithfully do according to His Word the moment you have chosen positively to rest your salvation in His saving power and grace alone. After you have thus believed, he purposes to supply all the enabling power to meet all the problems and the needs of your daily life. You need not fear, only believe His Word. His wisdom, strength and bounty are sufficient for you. -117That is how the final chapter of Lewis Spery Chafer's classic book Salvation: God's Marvelous Work of Grace begins. The book, as the final chapter is called, is an appeal for the sinner to come to Christ and to embrace the gospel. This classic is an evangelistic in its nature, but it certainly is not a track where the gospel is over-simplified. Instead, the theologian walks the reader through every basic aspect of the gospel from sin to the cross to the atonement to the resurrection to redemption to the sinner's response to the believers benefits to the assurance of salvation to eternal salvation and to our final destination.Chafer pounds the pages with Scripture references. He helpfully provides a Scriptural index in the back of the book which reveals just how prevalent the Bible is in this book. Oftentimes Chafer will state and thesis and essentially list a number of passages that defend his argument.There were many moments where I was shouting, ""Amen!"" In the third chapter of the book Chafer deals with those who challenge the doctrine of penal substitution. It reads as if he were writing today. He points out the empty rhetoric of his day and ours that suggests that the cross makes Christ a victim of an abusive, vindictive Father (the cross is ""divine child abuse"" for example). Chafer rightly condemns and corrects any notion of immorality in believing in substituionary atonement.Though there were many Amens, there is one section in particular that highly disappointed me. Chafer was a leading voice in the Lordship controversy that argued that one only needs to believe, but not repent. This is not the place to fully lay out everything regarding the Lordship controversy of a few decades ago. However, Chafer dedicates a large section of one chapter to this issue. He painstakingly suggests and tries to defend the notion that repentance is not necessary for salvation. His argument is weak. One is hard pressed to read the Old or the New Testament without seeing that God demands repentance from His children.Overall, however, this is a great book. Though I have some reservations in certain sections, this is an extremely helpful book in laying out the gospel. Although I would not put it into the hands of a lost person for various reasons, it is a helpful guide to those who might be considering embracing the gospel and also to believers who need to hear that message again (and we all need to daily!). If you can get by the Lordship issue (and that is an important issue to say the least), this is an excellent read.This book was given to me courtesy of Kregel Publications for the purpose of this review."
0070125384,The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for Nonfinancial Managers,"Summary 1: This book starts teaching before chapter one even gets under way by setting the expectation that you really can learn (and better, apply) finance no matter what you're trying to do.The sample situation that follows all the way through the book really helps focus on the concepts being taught. Some of the examples are humorous and some make you want to share what you're reading with a loved one.I bought this book because I'm just starting to deal with the budget aspects of network management, and needed to figure out how to lay out what I want to do technically to non-technical folks who have the company checkbook. I already know what I want to do, how much it will cost - demonstrating benefits and describing it in language the &quot;C&quot; team - CEO, CFO - speaks really helps.One of the best discoveries for me while reading this book is that in addition to helping me achieve the goal above, I found the concepts are applicable to budgeting for the home as well.It's definitely worth a read!
Summary 2: I'd definately recommend this book to anyone who feels phased by finance. Either as a refresher course to revamp finance skills long gone or for newcomers to the subject. The material is very relevant and extremely readable which makes an otherwise droll subject quite lively and interesting. I would have given this book 5 stars but being the pedantic reader that I am, I discovered that some of the calculations were actually inaccurate and, even worse, the answers to the review questions were wrong too. This doesn't help when you're not a natural number cruncher and need solid accuracy to assist in the learning process. Needless to say, its still a fundamentally good book and I know I'll be referring to it over again to make sure the basic concepts stick.
Summary 3: What a great book! It's easy to read, funny and it does a great job of explaining, piece by piece, the aspects of finance and it's interaction with a small business. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who owns a business, is thinking of owning a business or just wants to better understand what the finance world looks like from the outside.It takes a black-box perspective on the subject to avoid dragging the reader into all the minute details while still giving the reader plenty to chew on, like COGS, depreciation, lease vs. buy decisions, and inventory valuation. The intent of this book is not to teach the reader to be an accountant but rather a book to teach the businessperson how to better use accounting as a tool so they can be more effective.And I *love* to use of the example small business of Rosie's Spouse Houses to tie each accounting concept directly to specific ""real-world"" situations. The great use of humor really helps break up what can be a relatively unpalatable topic.The only place this book falls a little short (but for good reason - it's already a long book!) is on financial statement analysis. For that, I'd recommend the book ""How To Read a Financial Report"" by John A. Tracy.I have (and will continue) to recommend this book to my friends who own small businesses."
0226143082,Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins,"Summary 1: This book is both an exhibtion catalogue to a show Derrida curated at the Louvre of drawings on the theme of blindness (complete with many reproductions of works) as well as a brillant investigation into the art of drawing by dealing with blindness as evidence of 'blindness' itself in every act of looking (and of course reproduction). As stated by Derrida, &quot;every drawing of 'the blind' is a drawing 'of' the blind.&quot; More than just an example of applied deconstruction, Derrida's reading of these drawings questions the very foudnation of western ideologies of 'looking' and 'seeing' taken for granted as self-evident by artists for centuries. By the end, one wonders who is the author, the artist, the curator?, as Derrida does more with these drawings 'for drawing' than they ever did for drawing themselves. This book is a necessity for any visual artist producing critical work in the 21st century.
Summary 2: Although Derrida can be difficult to follow sometimes, this work is extremely intriguing and thought provoking. Well illustrated as well, as should be expected considering it was the catalogue for an exhibition.
Summary 3: Here Derrida offers a vision of blindness, that is to say a ""vision"" of ""blindness"", or even a ""vis""ion of ""blind""ness. By deconstructing the very ""act"" of see""ing"", he defers to diff&eacute;rance, grammatology, and ""&eacute;perons"", that is to say, the ""spurs"" by which we harry, that is to say hurry, the horse(s) of structuralized condescension. Perception, that is, or ""interception"", or even ""interperception"" of vision--or more precisely, visuality, and all that implies. Reading, and re-reading, this book, we can easily understand why Derrida and his thought were so instrumental in the fall of apartheid."
1581345976,The New Testament: English Standard Version,"Summary 1: The trade paperback compact version of the English Standard Version (ESV) New Testament has been a great resource for me. I was looking for a version of the ESV that was extremely compact, which I could drop in my pocket and not even feel it was there. My Gideon's New Testament (New King James Version) had previously fit this description well, except for my reading I prefer the ESV for many reasons which are beyond the scope of this review.Crossway has released a compact thinline bonded leather, which I was about to order, but when a girl in my small group showed me hers I decided that it was a great little package but still a little too thick and too bulky (containing the whole old testament...which makes me still want to buy it and maybe put up with the inconvenience for the privilege of having the entire scriptures available to me in my pocket). Then I got an email a couple of weeks later from discerning reader, saying that the trade paperbook ESV was for sale for two bucks. I jumped on it and bought two, one for me and one for my wife.It has now become my daily companion to classes, to work, and pretty much anywhere else I go. My only complaint is that it does not include Psalms like so many other New Testaments do. I appreciate that in such a small package Crossway did not skimp and provided red letters for the words of Jesus.As a final note, apparently Crossway is getting better with their binding. After two months of extreme use, the binding is holding up fine with no apparent signs of wear.My advice, for such a little cost, go ahead and buy this one. Maybe add it to your wishlist or your cart for that day when your order only hits twenty-two bucks and you need that extra little bit to get you to free shipping. :-)In Christ,-Jacob Hantla
Summary 2: I love the ESV translation and rate it five stars. I am upset that the publisher of this translation so poorly packages its product. This edition is a ""shirt pocket"" edition that seems well bound but has impossibly small print.What is needed is a ""coat pocket"" size edition of the New Testament that is bound in such a way that it will lie open of its own accord. The print size should be 10 or higher. This present edition will not lie open, and, what the more, the print is so small that only an ant could read it.Crossway publishes only two editions of the New Testament alone, and both are inferior. The print is too small to be read with enjoyment. Something has to change!
Summary 3: this Bible fits perfectly in my back pocket, and the font size is not too small!
Summary 4: My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose."
074932208X,Swan,"Summary 1: Hello people. First of all, Naomi Campbell did not write this book. It was written for her. She has admitted this in interviews. Why would anyone want to read a novel written by a supermodel anyway. I guess people who read books authored by Fabio would dig it
Summary 2: This book was absolutely fabulous! The book is definately a page turner up to the very last page. Naomi weaves the lives of a dozen characters seamlessly. It was very modern and informative. There is a peak at the great exciting and the not so glamorous sides to fashion. The book explains cultural, racially, and international differences thoughts and traditions that just made me think about the role I play as a public viewer and a consumer. Even though it was a fictionalized story there were so many real to life examples of things that happen. It really made me think. I loved the characters, the designs, the designers, the talk of the clothes, romance, sexy scenes(without being trashy), and the kindred networking and friendship between the women characters in the book. I also enjoyed the suspense. Naomi even gives humanity to the most unsavory characters. I hope that Naomi Campbell sends another novel our way. This book is a great read.
Summary 3: A fictional story that portrays the ups-and-downs of 5 fashion models and their rise to the top. There is Cassie, the All-American blonde; Celestia, an aristocratic beaty; Gigi, the spunky Cuban immigrant and Amy, the second generation Jamaican. We also hear from Swan, the supermodel, who has her own story to tell.... As we learn more and more about each one, their lives become intertwined.... an interesting story and hard to put down!
Summary 4: This is a very fascinating book that lets you see inside the minds of five unique characters (plus Swan herself). It centers around the five amateur models on the shortlist to replace supermodel Swan for a cosmetics campaign. There are so many things going on in this book that it never has time to get boring! The characters are written with excellent detail and realism and the story has lots of twists and turns. Impossible to put down!

1568330812,"1,999 Facts About Blacks: A Sourcebook of African-American Achievement","Summary 1: This book is filled with information about African-Americans and their accomplishments that every person should know. Do you know which U.S. President established the Office of Minority Affairs? Who was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D.? What state east of the Mississippi was the first to give African-American women the right to vote, in 1913? These are just some of the questions you'll find in this volume. I especially liked having each set of answers on the same page as the questions. The author also includes a helpful bibliography for further study. Highly Recommended.

1574883259,Pilot Error: Anatomy of a Plane Crash,"Summary 1: But sometimes it seems that way and for New York lawyer Ron Sinzheimer, on October 9, 1998, it was beyond dangerous, it was deadly. There aren't any more General Aviation accidents here than other parts of the country and there's nothing particularly stunning about this one so there's little reason to remember it. A man and the family dog in a single engine Grumman Traveler flying into the Cape to link up with his wife and son at their vacation home. Because I remember this accident, live nearby in Brewster, and it speaks to something of keen interest to me, my perception of the book may be quite colored and thus this &quot;five-star&quot; review. Nevertheless Phaedra Hise has written a compelling story that will be of interest to a much broader audience than GA pilots and people who live on the Cape.The challenges associated with flying to and from the Cape are all to do with weather, specifically fog and haze. That means &quot;instrument flight rules&quot; and talking about flying as different from &quot;visual flight rules&quot; as night is from day. Besides the personal tragedy to the Sinzheimer family, the thrust of Hise's book is that once a pilot has lost visual reference to the horizon things very quickly begin to unwind. It takes a sharp pilot to sort out the conflict between what his senses say - &quot;i'm turning&quot; - and what the instruments read - wings are level. PILOT ERROR is too innocuous a description for the multitude of things (mostly bad) that are taking place in such situations. Sometimes the various instruments seem to be contradicting each other and you must fight the panic that comes when your mind screams that it needs a visual reference in order to understand.Hise could have used a famous case that everyone would have remembered in order to get across her message that instrument flight rules are a critical skill for any GA pilot. The struggle with understanding what his instruments were telling him was the same for John F Kennedy Jr when he was flying through haze on the way to Martha's Vineyard in 1999. Using his flight would have meant focusing on him rather than where the real story is - five small instrument dials, that GA pilots must be absolutely familiar with - lest we become an accident statistic or the subject of a powerfully descriptive and very well written book.
Summary 2: In Pilot Error, Phaedra Hise masterfully recreates on the page the lone-pilot crash of Ron Sinzheimer, en route to Cape Cod from Albany on a cloud-bound Friday night. A pilot herself and a deft writer, Hise spins a taught story of the bad weather, bad luck, hubris and random events that ensnared the star lawyer in his tragic flight. At the same time she informs readers on the roles of the many professionals who make America's air traffic as remarkably safe as it is. Hise has created a moving and enlightening vignette that avoids melodrama even in the gut-wrenching scenes where Sinzheimer's wife, Marsha, slowly comes to grips with the fact that her husband is not coming home. The book ultimately makes his fate more than just another forgotten human tragedy. Hise should be commended. At the same time, Pilot Error is a read you put down only when you need to take a deep breath and whisper to yourself, ""There but for the grace of God . . . ."" After reading this book, those of us who ride behind the cockpit will never take our crew or air traffic controllers for granted again.
Summary 3: The author did a superb job in researching and documenting all the events leading up to this crash. However, as an instrument rated pilot familiar with the Provincetown approaches and similar small planes, it is apparent to me that Phaedra missed the root cause of this accident. Without revealing what Phaedra believes happened, I believe that she has overlooked the simplest explanation of all, which is that Sinzheimer never used his VOR-ILS instruments to fly the ILS-7 Provincetown approach, but instead used his much newer GPS (with moving map display) to fly an illegal ""pilot improvised approach"". I say this because the simplest explanation for why the primary VOR was not found tuned to the ILS-7 approach frequency is that he had never set it to that frequency in the first place. The GPS would not provide glideslope (vertical) guidance, so his logical work-around was to drop down to 100 feet and skim along the water inbound to the airport. Provincetown was a tempting spot to try this because it sits at an elevation of 8 feet above sea level and there aren't any tall obstructions anywhere near by. The problem with this technique (besides being illegal) is that flying at 100' above the water in poor visibility is very tricky. Under these weather conditions, there wouldn't be any visual references outside the cockpit with which to control the plane visually until he was less than a mile from the airport. Alternatively, flying on instruments at 100 feet above the water is theoretically possible, but I would not want to bet my life on my ability to do it. It appears to me that this is exactly what Sinzheimer did. Read the book and see what you think.
Summary 4: Pretty good book. The author really did a lot of research with the people who were personally involved with the accident. She also did a good job by not writing the book as a lengthend NTSB report but rather the whole process the FAA, Coast Guard, and NTSB have in place to react to a downed airplane. She gave a lot of background information also and sometimes even too much. I really didn't get why she would write about the Mayflower or the history of the Coast Guard but it was her book to write, not mine.
Summary 5: I read this book and concluded that I am angry at myself for having read it. Pilots like to read about accidents hoping to study a case and avoid the same mistakes. After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: ""you are now all dumber after hearing this story"". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal."
0140076980,"The Plug-in Drug: Television, Children, and the Family; Revised Edition","Summary 1: For a long time I have been discouraged in my efforts to establish two-way communication with children. I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity. Why won't they provide any input of their own? Am I overpowering them without realizing it?This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!
Summary 2: Read 4 Arguments...Jerry Mander Then this book! If you are looking for &quot;ways&quot; to get rid of the TV, or &quot;ways&quot; to occupy your families (or your) time away from the TV. This is not the book. This is the book if you would like statistics, and startling information about TV in the lives of people. Although the TV refrences are quite early 80's ALL of the information is very useful, persuasive, and passionate.Dont believe the hype up there! It is relevant to this day in age, take yourself to account, before the TV takes you! Buy this book and dont burry it into the shelves, pass it on the neighbors, your childrens teachers, family and friends! this book is for EVERYONE!
Summary 3: Excellent. A must read for parents of kids of all ages.It is really well written and should make a responsible parent a believer. Kill the TV before it kills your kids brains or at least be very selective as to what they watch.
Summary 4: A wonderful book, that all parents should read in order to eliminate their TVs and *live* again.
Summary 5: Before I read this book, I was excited to get all of the latest movies and cartoons on DVD so my child could watch re-runs over and over. Since I've read this book I haven't allowed my son to watch any TV at all. I must admit that it's nearly impossible. TV is so pervasive in our everyday lives that it's hard to avoid when you're out in public or at someone else's house. It's hard to do it even at my own home (my spouse won't read the book and won't listen to the arguments). People are addicted and are blissfully ignorant about the effects of television.I have had a great deal of difficulty convincing my friends and family that television actually does ""rot"" the brains of our children. And no one will read this book just to say that they read it but disagree. So many connections are yet to be made in a child's developing brain and people don't stop to ask the very basic question-- what are all of these rapid flashing images doing to the development of the brain?If you read this book and believe the arguments presented, keep it to yourself. Otherwise take notes. You'll need the notes to defend yourself because no one is going to believe you."
0826414370,Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring,"Summary 1: King Solomon tells us in Ecclesiastes that there is nothing new under the sun. All that has come before will come again. Whenever we think we've uncovered something new about ourselves or the world, all we need do is look to history to set us straight.Ken Bazyn, editorial director of the Religious Book Club, offers an insightful look at history in The Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring. In this readable, yet intricate work, he gives us a literary, religious and philosophical perspective on the seven &quot;perennial&quot; or &quot;root-sins&quot;: pride, envy, anger, avarice (greed), lust, gluttony and sloth (apathy). While the very idea of sin has fallen out of fashion--as pointed out to me by a colleague who once remarked that &quot;sin is a Western concept&quot;--we see it in action every day.Bazyn masterfully examines how writers, theologians and philosophers viewed each perennial sin and its ""offspring"" or variation. Each of the seven is at the root of all others. For example, murder is not listed as one of the seven because it is not a root-sin; it may arise from anger or avarice or envy or all seven.As an English major, I appreciated Bazyn's liberal use of literary examples to illustrate the recurring theme. He states at the outset that literature &quot;has a pleasing indirectness that catches us unawares&quot; and that stories help us to &quot;flesh out abstract principles and imprint them on our memories.&quot; Just as Jesus Christ's parables reflected what was in men's hearts, stories can hold up a mirror that reflects our own nature.From such literary characters as Jay Gatsby, Bartleby the Scrivener, Dr. Jekyll, and a host of Biblical figures, Bazyn shows how each perennial sin manifests itself in their tortured lives. He quotes such men as Nietzsche, Kant, St. Augustine and C.S. Lewis, and refers to historical events such as the French Revolution and the Vietnam War to build an overarching theme of how human fallacies plague us all. While Bazyn's book is an excellent study of history and literature, I found myself relishing passages of his own original thoughts and wished he'd used more of a balance in technique.The Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring makes reference to many forgotten stories once read in high school and college, ones that gave us metaphors to &quot;help us cope with life's complexities and contradictions,&quot; Bazyn writes. Public school educators in America would be wise to return to the study of great literature and Western culture. In the twenty-first century, moral relativism has all but eroded the concept of sin. Some redefine it; others deny it. Ken Bazyn reiterates throughout his book that sin is a deep-rooted, unchanging, universal and permanent condition of man. We would do well to call it what it is.King Solomon tells us that no one on earth is free from sin. What, then, is our hope? &quot;Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.&quot; A perennial solution to a perennial problem.2003 La Shawn BarberOriginally published on Townhall.com.
Summary 2: A very well written and insightful book. Bazyn uses an impressive number of examples from the Bible, other sacred texts, and literature, to make his points. Because of this, the book might seem overwhelming to someone who is not well-read. On the other hand, Bazyn's writing is accessible and easy to understand. The book offers good and practical advice for living a better life. My only disappointments were one or two isolated comments by Bazyn which I feel downplay the evil of abortion.
Summary 3: I was pleased with my purchase. The books arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. Thank You.
Summary 4: Bazyn's next project should be a ransom note. This was a collection of quotes taken from other writers, pieced together, and presented as a book. I don't think there was a single paragraph that did not have a quote. It is one thing to use quotes to support your work, or to provide examples. It is entirely different, and unacceptable, for an author to use quotes to make all of the author's points.Good premise. Poor product. Disappointing."
0072259558,Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (Hacking Exposed),"Summary 1: Here is the thing - I am giving this book a high score (4) since it contains unique and fun content related to network infrastructure attacks and defenses, which I have not seen anywhere else. In my view, the good stuff justifies such score, although I suspect that some other reviewers will sledgehammer the book for having too much of routine material covered in other previous books, including the venerable Hacking Exposed.While I had a general idea of how providers mitigate DDoS attacks, I did not know the specifics of unicast reverse-path forwarding method, described in the book. Similarly, I picked up a lot of material of setting up sinkholes for dropping traffic (and, more specifically, how they are better than ACLs in many cases).From other topics, I liked their coverage on the evolution of DMZ from simple designs of years past to current security zone design.The book also presents a lot of up-to-date material, such as the coverage of security information management (SIM), vulnerability management and recent security standards, such as CVSS. It doesn't go into details in some places where I'd wanted it to, but still is interesting to read.On the other hand, some chapters are disappointing and seem to be in the book for it to appear ""comprehensive"". Forensics chapter is one of those (it is also mistakenly called ""Exploiting Forensics"", while no exploitation is taking place)I recommend the book for most people, from beginners to advanced, since the former will enjoy the breadth of coverage while the latter will likely benefit from the network infrastructure protection (and devastation, of course!) tips. In addition, defense checklists in the end of each chapter are useful for those who do not have time to go and study the material in-depth. The book is slightly biased towards the defense side, with good coverage of the attacking side as well.Dr Anton Chuvakin, GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a recognized security expert and book author. In his current role as a Security Strategist with netForensics, a security information management company, he is involved with defining future features and conducting security research. A frequent conference speaker, he also represents the company at various security meetings and standard organizations. He is an author of a book ""Security Warrior"" and a contributor to ""Know Your Enemy II"", ""Information Security Management Handbook"" and the upcoming ""Hacker's Challenge 3"". Anton also published numerous papers on a broad range of security subjects. In his spare time he maintains his security portal at info-secure.org and a blog at O'Reilly""
Summary 2: Regardless of how many steps you take to secure your organizational computing environment, there's always some new exploit waiting to nail you. The best you can do is to understand your network and stay on top of the technology. Extreme Exploits - Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks by Victor Oppleman, Oliver Friedrichs, and Brett Watson can help you in that pursuit, especially in the networking realm...Contents:Part 1 - Core Internet Infrastructure for Security Professionals: Internet Infrastructure for Security Professionals; ISP Security Practices - Separating Fact from Fiction; Securing the Domain Name SystemPart 2 - Defending Your Perimeter and Critical Internet Infrastructure: Reliable Connectivity; Securing the Perimeter; Redefining the DMZ - Securing Critical Systems; Intrusion Detection and Prevention; E-mail Gateways, Filtering, and Redundancy; Data Leaks - Exploiting Egress; Sinkholes and Backscatter; Securing Wireless NetworksPart 3 - Network Vulnerability Assessments: Vulnerability and Patch Management; A Winning Methodology for Vulnerability Assessments; Performing the Assessment - Part 1, Performing the Assessment - Part 2Part 4 - Designing Countermeasures for Tomorrow's Threats: Exploiting Digital Forensics; Viruses, Worms, Trojans, and Other Malicious Code; Exploiting SoftwareIndexThe authors of this book are real gurus when it comes to networking technology. I worked with Brett Watson at a prior place of employment, and I can attest to the fact that he really knows his trade. In the first part of this book, they go into networking and security probably deeper than any other book I've had the opportunity to review. To get the most out of the material, it helps to be firmly grounded in networking technology. If you're not a network administrator or if you're just starting out, you'll probably struggle to keep up. Parts 2 and 3 are also valuable sections. Part 2 continues the in-depth analysis of how best to protect your network from attack, along with software recommendations to implement your security plans. And if you aren't already using a formal methodology to continuously review your network security, Part 3 will help you set up the necessary framework to implement a solid security review. Part 4 probably is the weakest part of the book, in that most of the material is available from multiple other sources, and doesn't necessarily fit into the ""extreme exploits"" flavor of the rest of the book. It's good information, to be sure... Just not all that unique or special if you've read more than one other security book.One feature at the end of each chapter stood out and works well... It's a ""Checklist for Developing Defenses"" along with a recommended reading list. Using the checklist allows you to make sure you understood what each chapter was getting at, as well as giving you a roadmap for implementing security in the particular area that was just discussed. And if a particular chapter was really applicable to your organization, the follow-up reading can help you get even deeper into the material. Good practical technique for helping the reader move from theory to application...If you have the basics of network security down, it's time to pick up a copy of this book. While you may have to work at understanding the material, it will pay off in a system network that is much more secure than most...
Summary 3: I read Extreme Exploits because the content looked intriguing and I am familiar with applications written by lead author Victor Oppleman. The back cover states the book is ""packed with never-before-published advanced security techniques,"" but I disagree with that assessment. While I found all of the content helpful, between 1/3 and 1/2 of it is probably available in older books -- including several by publisher McGraw-Hill/Osborne. Nevertheless, I find the strength of the network infrastructure security sections powerful enough to recommend Extreme Exploits.I found Extreme Exploit's most innovative material in chapter 1 (Internet Infrastructure), 2 (ISP Security Practices), 4 (Reliable Connectivity), 8 (Email Gateways, Filtering, and Redundancy), 10 (Sinkholes and Backscatter, and 14 (Performing the Assessment, Part 1). These chapters introduced projects like RADB, IRRd, INOC-DBA (a VoIP ""hotline"" for ISPs), the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (an anti-spam system), and Hashcash (to consume CPU cycles and frustrate spammers). Subjects like questions to ask ISPs, ways to multi-home, and using anycast to improve redundancy were also welcome. A comment that spammers are using people who register with porn sites to pass CAPTCHA tests really surprised me! Ch 10's coverage of ISP sinkholes was clear, and I learned about triggered blackhole routing. Advice on checking publicly announced routes was cool, especially the reference to the author's Pwhois system.Although the vulnerability and patch management information in ch 12 was fairly routine, I also liked the author's mention of recent industry projects like the NIAC vulnerability lifecycle and Common Vulnerability and Scoring System.Other chapters mainly covered topics found in other books, like Hacking Exposed, Gray Hat Hacking, or Hardening Network Security (all Osborne titles). Most of the book contains sound advice, but I must disagree with several assertions made in ch 7 (Intrusion Detection and Prevention). These include the ""rejection"" of the value of passive detection (p 116), the ""logical transition"" where detection and prevention converges into firewalls (p 116), the idea that intrusion prevention systems are ""less prone to insertion and evasion attacks"" (p 120), and ""signature-based IDS normally do not have an understanding of the underlying protocol that they are examining and simply perform byte-by-byte pattern matching"" (p 121).Almost all of the vulnerability assessment material could have been cut, aside from the BGP query and network infrastructure advice in ch 14. The misnamed ""exploiting digital forensics"" chapter (16) tempts the reader into thinking it will cover anti-forensics, but really it's an overview of network-, host-, and memory forensics in 26 pages. An excerpt from p 332 summarizes the problem with the chapter: ""At this point, you might be asking, what do I do with the data?"" Still, ch 16 deserves an honorable mention for describing multiple tools with which I was not familiar or had only passing familiarity. These included Foremost by Jesse Kornblum and Kris Kendall, Disktype, and Memdump.In terms of structure, I liked the fact that every chapter concluded with a ""checklist for developing defenses"" summarizing important points in an actionable format. The writing is always clear, and the diagrams are excellent. Many of the network infrastructure suggestions are supported by command-line syntax and examples, consistent with Osborne's Hacking Exposed style.Overall, I think most everyone will learn something by reading Extreme Exploits. Those with a decent amount of experience or who have read books already mentioned might find some of the book repetitive. Despite this, I learned a lot about network infrastructure and I look forward to reading Victor's upcoming book on ""Carrier Class Network Security.""
Summary 4: The book has two major sections: (a) configuration and maintenance practices, and (b) techniques for vulnerability assessment. The breadth of coverage of many modern techniques and terminology is very good; they go in-depth on a few topics here and there.The basic assumption of section (a) is that you're trying to defend against unknown/unfixable threats. This is basically the current (2001-2005-) school of thought on security and leads to default-deny policies. This book has lots of good information on how to implement default-deny. The book convinced me that it's much more difficult than a default-deny firewall rule.The book has many contributing authors; this probably contributes to its strength.Many books are focused on ISPs, or on enterprises (read: ""windows clients and servers with a firewall""), or on software developers, or VoIP carriers. This book has some good material for all of those types.It's written from a Unix perspective. It does have some coverage of analyzing threats to Windows-based systems, but you'll get the most value from the book as an analyst/administrator if you use some sort of Unix. They have a BSD bias.The authors also have an bias towards open-source software.But it's not perfectly integrated, and the organization isn't ideal everywhere. For example, there are two sections of the book that discuss buffer overflows, apparently contributed by two different authors.The index is only minimal; it only covers one of the sections on stack overflows. Bad indexes are a common problem in technical books from some publishers.
Summary 5: First I must admit that I know and have worked with several of the authors of this book. I was given an autographed copy of the book late last year, however seeing as the book was published in 2005 I didn't think there would be much along the lines of useable information seeing as many of the security threats and vulnerabilities have evolved quite a bit since then. However, as I started reading the book I quickly realized much of the information was still relevant today as it was several years ago. The chapters on ISP Security Practices and Securing the Domain Name System had very good coverage of many of the techniques used throughout Service Provider networks to secure their network and DNS infrastructure.I particularly enjoyed reading the sections on using egress packet filters to restrict data leaks from within an organization - a particular problem today with the prevalance of Internet Worms and other Malware which often attempt to communicate back to their centralized Command & Control (C&C;) hosts. The chapter on 'Sinkholes and Backscatter' has very good coverage on a wide variety of topics such as using Darknets and Honeynets to monitor malicious traffic and other nasties emanating throughout your network, as well as using techniques such as Triggered Blackhole Routing to propagate filters quickly and dynamically to drop DDoS and other malevolent traffic.I would have to disagree with Dr. Anton Chuvakin that the chapters on Digital Forensics were disappointing. Personally, I learned quite a bit from these chapters and came away from reading them with a whole arsenal of new tools to use with which I can perform my own digital forensics on compromised systems. The coverage of Foremost, memdump, and some of the advanced digital forensic tools was top notch.All in all, I would say this is still a good book for anyone involved in Network Security. Much of the information covered is still relevant in today's networks. If the authors attempt to release a second edition I would suggest coverage of adapting Triggered Blackhole techniques to be used in more modern DDoS Mitigation scenarios. Additionally, discussion of new techniques used for Malware C&C; and coverage of Fast-flux and Double-flux techniques used by the attackers to create more robust and reliable networks would be welcomed."
B0006BP8QO,"Basic course in Estonian, (Indiana University publications. Uralic and Altaic series, v. 54)","Summary 1: I borrowed this book to learn the rudiments of the Estonian language to prepare for a trip to Estonia. This is a college textbook, and it is very thorough. Each unit divided into (1) basic sentences in Estonian (with English translations), (2) notes on grammar, (3) exercises with answers, and (4) conversations. The back of the textbook has an excellent glossary (dictionary). In the preface, the author says &quot;[T]he availability of a native speaker of Estonian for covering the material....would be especially important at the initial stage of study, for going over the pronunciation exercises and the first units.&quot; For self-study, this book is rough going. There are no maps of Estonia, no photos, and no charts or tables; the book consists of only typewritten pages. There are also no accompanying cassettes for practice. The glossary in the back of the book lists the Estonian words with the English translation. A suggested improvement: have a second section where the English words are listed with Estonian translations (a &quot;reverse-glossary&quot;). This text is an excellent resource for the serious student of the Estonian language. It is an excellent textbook for a language course with an instructor, but, in my opinion, less useful for the self-learner (like myself).
Summary 2: For some reason, the Indiana University has published two different courses in Estonian. This one, and the Estonian Textbook by Juhan Tuldava. While this book is certainly as good as many other language courses on the market, it falls short of the level reached by Tuldava's course, both in terms of user friendliness and in depth cover. For this reason, I would recommend Tuldava's Estonian Textbook rather than this course.
Summary 3: This book is described on how-to-learn-any-language.com as ""the most comprehensive Estonian course available"". Unfortunately Amazon does not offer the 32 audio CDs/tapes that are integral to the course. Eight of the first nine units of audio are available free online at Indiana University. The complete course (text and audio) is available at Audio Forum and Multilingual Books.See you at the Song and Dance Celebration in July 2009!"
0253206812,Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary,"Summary 1: Representing Reality theorizes documentary in all-round perspectives. Among others, I think this book is important especially in that it raises the question of reality per se. Documentary has always been marginal not only in discourse but also in cinema industry, under the poor understanding of reality. I think Nichols's notion of &quot;reflexivity&quot; is a key concept itself in understanding documentary, which also provides a good alternative reading regarding what is documentary or not. I think this book will give you a great deal of food for thought, when you have ever contemplated what is real and when we become to question about what we are seeing, not only in films but also in real life.
Summary 2: This attempt at discussing documentary film is fraught with difficulties for the reader. The prose is clumsy, circumstantial and muddled to the point that I found myself reading passages aloud to others for help. Unfortunately none was forthcoming.There is little excuse to buy this book when there are so many good ones such as those by Barnouw and Jacobs which area clear and informative.
Summary 3: Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like &quot;situatedness,&quot; &quot;hyperrationality,&quot; &quot;reconceptualization,&quot; &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;relationality,&quot; &quot;talismanic&quot;(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: &quot;juxtaposition.&quot; Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy &quot;Representing Reality&quot; unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."
0972023402,Powerful Golf,"Summary 1: Michael J. Russ' Powerful Golf: Lower Your Golf Score By Changing The Way You Think is a 77-minute CD audiobook that teaches the listeners how to improve their golf scores by taking control of their attitudes and emotions. From learning to rise above anger and frustration; to the use of heightened awareness; the implementation of practical self-talk; and the transcendental virtue of forgiveness, Powerful Golf presents itself as an exceptional motivational guide and especially appropriate for a sport in which confidence makes or breaks the player. If you play a dedicated game of golf, then Powerful Golf is the audiobook for you!
Summary 2: I only picked up golf last October and though I have taken many lessons I seemed to be stuck in a rut. I love to listen to books on tape when I am driving, it makes the time go faster. So when I saw this book about golf on, it seemed perfect. Not only was it easy to listen to, but it was also very clear and concise. The author is very focused on getting your mental game in order as a way to lower your golf score. I didn't realize what a big part the mental game played until I listened to this. My score has begun to drop off its plateau and I am now hovering in the 103 range. With these concepts in place each time I play I feel that I will be playing bogey golf within the month. Kudos to the author for touching on a subject which is rarely taught and seldom thought about.
Summary 3: I purchased this audio book for my husband whose game is well beyond the skill level addressed in this book. He told me this book would probably be good for players hoping to break 90, who need help with developing the proper golf swing.
Summary 4: My 19 year old son took up golf about 3 years ago, and seemed to enjoy it - but for the fact that if he missed a shot he would throw his clubs, pitch a tantrum, and mess up the remainder of his game. It took about 3 weeks, but this audio book helped us work on him focusing on what was important, and letting go of the bad stuff. After all, we ALL have bad games. Now, he's much better at taking his time, and when his ball is in the bushes, he deals with it, and let's it go."
0964896818,Holy War Online: A Debate in Cyberspace,"Summary 1: This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me.
Summary 2: After having been told about this book by a good friend who also could not believe it she was finally able to get the copy borrowed again from her co-worker. The first 50 pages or so were mildly interesting only if the topic interested you (it didn't interest me) and if you lean towards people having sometimes idiotic arguments appeals to you. Then after around six weeks of this nonsense is when the ""author"" gets involved in the tpic discussion. The ""author"" seems to have an agenda right from the start and yes that agenda seeems to be agitation, irritation, sowing discord and creating a climate to intentionally encourage retaliation. I even wondered if the objective right from the start was to create a scene where the ""author"" would then be able to do noting more than copy all of the postings and caal it a book. In his conclusion he speas of a sequel which makes one think even more that this was a ""set up"" from the start. And the concluding posting is such a childish example of ""getting in the last word"" and in such a demeaning way that the author should be ashamed. Glad this was a borrowed book!
Summary 3: Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
0791076148,Maritime & Port Security (SEC Nat) (Securing Our Nation),"Summary 1: Maritime and Port Security by Captain Fred Evans is a guide for company, facility, and vessel personnel responsible for formulating policy in anticipation of maritime security incidents. The book covers many aspects of maritime security in response to domestic and international terrorism and other criminal acts including history, funding, and implementation.* ""Pilots and flight attendants had been taught to handle hijackers in much the way that a bank teller is taught to deal with a bank robber - to cooperate, to surrender what the aggressor wants, and to stall as much as possible in the hope that reinforcements will arrive. On 9/11, we learned the hard way that this training was not a valid way of handling a modern hijacking."" P 19Maritime and Port Security will be appreciated by all members of the maritime industry. It should also be read by students interested in national defense, international commerce, and the effects of globalization.* ""If terrorists could interrupt the flow of trade by creating so much fear and anxiety that free and open market principles would be sacrificed in favor of a system of heavy security inspection and regulation, they would have succeeded in slowing the progress of democratic and advanced economic countries of the world."" P 31* ""In the highly competitive business of global commercial shipping, all costs must be justified and demonstrate a value added to product or service and a verifiable return on an investment. When developing an effective shipboard security program, the tests of value added and return on investment are difficult to quantify."" P 37It is meant to be read in conjunction with other texts in the Securing the Nation: Issues in American National Security Since 9/11 series which include - Intelligence: The Human Factor, and Narcotics and Terrorism.* Maritime security personnel must be deployed in a ""balanced manner to deal optimally with any criminal threats or acts they may encounter. In order to do this successfully, a steady and reliable process of threat intelligence analysis and investigation must be ongoing. This analysis requires close cooperation with both domestic and international law enforcement agencies."" P 57This is a very interesting and much needed book, although brief, on a subject where there will hopefully be additional research and publication. In any event, it is well written and worth the money.
Summary 2: This is a most interesting, well thought out book. It give good, concise details of 9/11 events. However I think it lacked depth and could have been more detailed about what is next in terms of Port Security. More emphasis neede to be placed on this area. Worth the money, overall I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend theis book
Summary 3: Another book, which although informative, does not introduce anything new. I enjoyed this book more than my previous reading ""America the Vulnerable"". I feel that this author has the capacity to produce some really good books along similar lines."
0813114721,Free Frank: A Black Pioneer on the Antebellum Frontier,"Summary 1: The book Free Frank is an academically written book, which combines a family history with a local and national timeline and societal view. Excellent for my research. Please note the times and treatment of non-white males was not-politicaly correct and is frankly at times depressing in it's accuracy and detail. The author freely notes some of the difficulties of doing family research on the frontier, during this time and especially facing non-free family research.
Summary 2: This is the most fascinating book I have ever read regarding what a person can do when he puts himself into it. Amazing sacrifice, determination and hard work, that was Frank McWhorter. A must read if you want to see a view of the mid 19th century by reading the life of a man who came out of slavery and lived in extreme hardship with integrity seldom seen these days.
Summary 3: This book is about a great man overcoming the odds. This book explains a lot about our early settlers and how slavery played an imprtant part of that development. The author did great research to give a true account of the life and times of ""Free Frank"". This should be read by all who want to hear the true story."
0192832999,Pancatantra: The Book of India's Folk Wisdom (Oxford World's Classics),"Summary 1: Pancatantra the ancient book of fables, is an interesting collection of animal stories composed in India around the third century of the Christian era. It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift.
Summary 2: This is a translation of an old Indian children's book that is, not surprisingly, also a moral tale on how to live, and, perhaps more importantly, how to govern. I'm not in a position to comment as to whether this is a good or bad translation; it is a fun read for adults and I suppose that a pretty progressive or multicultural parent could read it to their kids in place of the Brothers Grimm or something else....I liked the book. Other books in the age-old stories of wisdom from around the world: &quot;Monkey: A Journey to the West&quot; by Wu Ch'eng-en (translated by Arthur Waley, among others), the tale of Mil-e-re-pa (translated by a number of people: this one might be too risque for a lot of kids....), the 'Meditations of Marcus Aureleus', and the 'Conference of the Birds' by Farud-din Attar. Not that I am an expert on raising kids through multicultural readings.....This is a neat book (though I think that this particular translation might be a bit dry.... it's been a while since I read it...) and it should be bought. And someone other than me should have reviewed it!
Summary 3: This is an eminently readable translation though I still prefer Arthur W. Ryder's translation. I believe Ryder's translation is currently out of print.
Summary 4: This is a fairly good book of philosophy and wisdom, ALTHOUGH it is quite fallacious in many regards, one of them being its authors' claim that a man is a self-sustaining intelligent being and all his wisdom must derive from himself (instead of God - as it is correctly believed in Christian, as well as Platonic tradition). Nevertheless the book is useful.Translation is extremely dull and unimpressive. It does not flow. It is a literal translation (word by word). Beauty of the writing is lost. The only way to retain it is by translating it idiomatically, and not word by word. For example, Narayana's Hittopadesa, also published as Oxford World Classics is such a beautiful read that it is almost musical - kudos to its translator. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about this book.
Summary 5: i had no problems with this seller. I received the book on the day I was told I would and it was in the condition advertised."
0812218140,Plain Style: A Guide to Written English,"Summary 1: The introductory essay alone makes this book worthwhile -- the editor traces Lasch's evolution as a historian, and shows how his interest in plain writing evolved along with his political thinking. The examples in the text are both entertaining and informative, and the writing advice is excellent. A good resource people who care about how writing and thinking impact our society.
Summary 2: Similar in style and tone (and usefulness) to Strunk &amp; White's classic &quot;Elements of Style&quot;. Short, pithy, intelligent. Lots of examples, followed by Professor Lasch's thoughtful, penetrating, often witty comments. Recommended for all undergrads.
Summary 3: Plain Style was written in 1985 by Christopher Lasch, a history professor who was frustrated with his students' lack of writing ability. There are six sections:Elementary Principles of Literary ConstructionConventions Governing Punctuation, Capitalization, Typography, and FootnotesCharacteristics of Bad WritingWords Often MisusedWords Often MispronouncedProofreaders' MarksApparently Lasch's frustration with students went beyond just their writing skills. ""I keep simplifying my course in 20th century American history, but the students keep getting dumber faster than I can simplify it,"" Lasch wrote in a letter to his father. ""Every year the illiteracy gets worse.""The current book was published after the author's death and includes an introduction by Stewart Weaver. The introduction is disproportionately long, taking up 42 of 121 pages.
Summary 4: I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference."
0842382801,Your Signature Life: Pursuing God's Best Every Day,"Summary 1: This book brought to my attention the importance of giving my best in the small details of daily living. Dianna Booher challenges you to evaluate what value your personal &quot;designer label&quot; holds. My favorite part of the book is when Dianna encourages you to &quot;consider yourself as the builder and owner of You,Inc.&quot;After reading this book, I shared the concept of being able to sign my signature to the end of every day's work as my personal best, much like Michelangelo, Monet or Renoir, with my eleven year daughter (who had been skimping on some math homework). A few days later, as I looked over her math notebook, I noticed she had signed her signature (&quot;Her Name, Inc.&quot;) at the end of every (much improved)lesson. When I asked her about it she said, &quot;I am doing my best work and I am proud of my personal label.&quot;I am grateful for the positive influence this book has had on our family. I want to commend Ms. Booher for being able to sign this book &quot;Dianna, Inc.&quot;, a personal best.
Summary 2: This is a beautifully written book that helps us to understand how what we say &amp; do affects other peoples life's both at the work place and in our daily life. Dianna uses real life examples that show just how taking the time for a kind word or deed can make a difference in showing God's love to others. I highly recommend that corporations have all of their employees read this book.
Summary 3: Personal accountability, integrity, character - whatever you label it, it's doing the right thing, even when no one else is watching. &quot;Your Signature Life&quot; is a personal-development home run!Through captivating imagery and intriguing statistics, Dianna Booher challenges us to examine our lives to see what kind of character we are developing. Do we reflect light or darkness? She shows us how our experiences and relationships may help to form the way we look at the world, but they do not have to define who we are or who we will become.Although we cannot control the actions of those around us, we are called to control our responses to those actions. Personal accountability is not a thing of the past. We can and must have it today if we ever hope to look back over our lives and smile. Others are watching. God is watching.Ms. Booher's latest release, &quot;Your Signature Life,&quot; is a triumph for those seeking to live a life of integrity and total fulfillment.
Summary 4: Wisdom and general life principles drawn from the Biblical book of Proverbs accompany an amazing compilation of quotes from scores of sources. Booher draws from these sources to walk the reader through a process for gaining wisdom, wisdom for those who show a commitment to morally right choices, pursuing God's best as you produce your own signature life.The book is made up of three sections:Part I: The signature life is compared to painting a portrait. This section concentrates on building character as a foundation for the finished product, a signature life. Each chapter in this section ends with a challenge for adding the finishing touch to the signature portrait.

0674510402,Language and Symbolic Power,"Summary 1: This book will most likely not appeal to US students in linguistics. Because Bourdieu deals with rather abstract concepts which cover a lot of social ground (e.g., symbolic, cultural, economic capital, field, etc.)and not enough linguistic ground, some linguists will have trouble applying concepts to the actual production of speech at the phonological, morpho-syntactic, pragmatic and discourse level. He never really deals with actual production of language by speakers, so it creates a lot of work for the reader to fill in the details of what, for example, an actual linguistic habitus might look like, what its dispositions might be, and how they might be coordinated in their habitus set.However, unlike many US linguists, he assumes there is an empirical connection between language use and larger social domains; furthermore, he is able to explain the way power often operates through exclusion and devaluation (dialect analysis). One of the less abstract chapters, the chapter on Searle, is excellent. Bourdieu accurately locates the efficacy of the speech act, not in the functional form of the utterances, such as christening, ordering, requesting, etc., but in the recognition by all involved that the agent who produces the speech act has the right to be obeyed and that the material circumstances of the speech act are appropriate. Mary Jane down the street and the mayor of NY may christen a new warship using the exact same functional words, but the power of those words depends on our recognition that, in this example, the mayor, not just anybody, has the authority to name. Bourdieu masterfully argues this point, and I would recommend reading that chapter first for its accessibility and accuracy in pointing out that the extra-linguistic is as much linguistic as the linguistic.
Summary 2: Bourdieu's point is not to explore linguistics but rather to explore the larger impact that language has on shaping symbols, meaning and power in the social context. Symbolic interactionists and conflict theorists would probally find this book to be a great read.
Summary 3: Pierre Bourdieu is mind-blowing in all of his writing, but this is easily one of my favorites! The title gives you a good indication about the content of the book. If you purchase it, you won't be able to put it down before you finish reading it. I confess that even after that I re-read it several times. Yes, it's THAT good!"
0679426108,Letters,"Summary 1: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?
Summary 2: Was disappointed in this exhaustive collection of letters. I'm a huge admirer of Kenneth Tynan - read his diaries around three times - but this just did not do it for me. I had high hopes for this book, and I like the stylish black and white presentation. But much of this is dry and businesslike. Anyone who knows anything about KT knows he had an outrageous sense of humor. And his range as a critic was distinctly wide - from the deep down lowbrow to the highest of highbrow. However, that predilection for life's ironies is not often found here.Yes, there are some interesting letters, but much of it isn't engaging. One touching letter that comes to mind is one Mr. Tynan sent to The Hemlock Society. It was written toward the end of his life, and he was exploring the option of assisted suicide. Tynan was a very heavy smoker who actually was genetically wired for emphysema. Even while struggling for breath and against all his wife Kathleen's admonitions, he continued to smoke. Smoking was a symptom of the serious self doubt that followed him throughout his life. In the end, and without leaving the definitive artistic statement, Kenneth Tynan sadly expired at age 50 in July 1980.It's so unfortunate that Kenneth Tynan is practically forgotten today, and all his work has been out of print for years. I consider myself lucky I was able to acquire most of his books before they disappear into oblivion.
Summary 3: Each generation in Britain seems to produce yet another variation on The Bright Young Thing from Oscar Wilde to Waugh to Chris Hitchens. In that cold and often rainy climate, dazzling young men and women flower at an uncommon early age. Their expressed purpose is to charm, impress and outrage their elders. Incorrigible showoffs all, they all spring from the same public schools and universities. No better specimen than Ken Tynan who, at age eleven, saw fit to write the critic of a Birmingham newspaper, praising the talents of a minor movie actor named Bogart. Nine years later, by the time he reached Oxford immediately after the Second World War, young Ken had honed his act to the same brilliant polish as his predecessors: the eccentric clothing, the excessive drinking and sexual conquests, the endless talk, the capacity to do all things day and night, and still read everything ever written. At university, Tynan acted, directed and wrote magazine articles and essays that impressed his tutor C.S. Lewis, and everyone else around him. Perhaps the best letter writing in this collection comes from those school days before celebrity, when Tynan, champion of the new and a lover of the popular arts--the film in particular--was a young man so in love with himself and life that he saw and heard everything everywhere. He fearlessly celebrated Frederick Volk's Othello as one of the great theater performances of his lifetime because it was so totally unlike anything that those great opera divas, Olivier, Richardson and Gielgud, were doing. As much as he admired Noel Coward, he knew the days of ""the ginny baritone"" were over, and that Osborne, Wesker, and the rest had every right to come to take his place in the nation's spotlight. As is so often the case with these bright comets, Tynan's light did not last forever. The latter part of this name-dropping book, when he was world famous and knew everyone worth knowing, may disappoint some, but there is no better example of British precocity at its shining best than these young man's letters to friends and lovers."
0750921218,The Regency Underworld,"Summary 1: The seamier side of London in the early nineteenth century written with flare. This book was an enjoyable romp through the back streets, slums and 'rookeries' of London and the attempts by authorities to control them.The book is packed full of detail of the people of the time including some of the more famous characters such as fences and theives and the methods they used to continue their trade. You can read about 'Mudlarks and scuffle hunters' of the river Thames, or if you prefer, the 'resurrectionists' who traded in dead bodies for medical students.Low also draws deeply on literature of the time such as Pierce Egan's &quot;Life in London&quot; which is chock full of authentic Regency-era slang. For instance Money could be referred to as &quot;Blunt, rhino, flash the screens, sport the rhino, show the needful, post the pony, nap the rent, stump the pewter, tip the brads down with the dust only get into tip street.&quot;Some great illustrations and a fun trip into the life among the lower orders.
Summary 2: When this book popped up on my reading rotation, I was really looking forward to what promised to be an interesting work. After all, how could an author miss with the subject matter of crime (and, hopefully, punishment) during one of the most deliciously dissolute periods of English history? Well, turns out that if he concentrates the major portion of the first part of the book on a too detailed background of the founding of the Metropolitan Police and only the last, relatively few, pages to interesting portraits of four of the era's notable scalawags, it can be done. In short, should have provided more vignettes and less of what amounts to legislative history. Overall, it reminded me of Jessica Warner's ""Craze: Gin and Debauchery in an Age of Reason:"" much promised, less delivered.
Summary 3: This book shocked me, educated me and was truly a page turner.I purchased this book as I am doing some research into the period and it didn't disappoint. The book focuses on the darker side of life which is present in every society in some form.If you are looking to understand our history and human nature you will discover that soccer hooliganism is nothing new.
Summary 4: This book, THE REGENCY UNDERWORLD, does a good job of depicting the social reality of London's underbelly, circa 1800. Unlit streets, bad smells, contaminated water and food, throngs of poor, excess wealth and fine taste, all merge nicely in this piece. The book does a fine job of capturing another world, one which would no doubt scare the daylights out of anyone today. It is one benchmark for speaking about ""progress"" in the course of 19th century England."
B0006YPII4,The alcohol fuel handbook,"Summary 1: This book is an excellent resource for those interested in self-sufficiency or those who just want to beat the rising costs of oil and gas. The book breaks down the facts and knowledge needed to make alcohol fuel into simple and easy to understand language. The basics of alcohol fuel production are laid out and the details of building your own still are included. Even if you are not interested in producing your own alcohol fuel, but are interested in learning more about ethanol and alcohol based fuels, this book provides you with the facts needed to understand this growing market.
Summary 2: This is an updated publication of a c. 1980 text. It is very informative on the properties of fuel alcohol and the different raw material possibilities. It also explains in some detail how to make ethanol on the farm-scale from improvised DIY equipment.It would benefit from a more up-to-date context and a slightly more commercial orientation, in my opinion.
Summary 3: I got this book to look into the practicality of making my own fuel. As a replacement for gasoline and driving my vehicle, it is not practical. As a resource for powering chainsaws, sawmill and other gas operated tools, it has some possibility. If you think growing your own fuel is a potential, read this book. I think you'll come to some of the same conclusions I did, but it is worth the expense to understand why.
Summary 4: In 1975 the Brazilian government had sucessfully introduced Alcool using as Fuel in wide range. We already produced about 6 million alcohol fuelled Vehicles in this period. Our gasoline is not pure, it is 1,1% to the 25% alcohol mixed. We avoided 110 million tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere. We saved about 11,5 billion American dollars in petroleum imports.North Americans and Europeans Citizens still have doubt regarding this theme. Brazilians Citizens have not!
Summary 5: I would not recommend this book. Anyone looking into alternative fuel should consider biodiesel, or electric power. Ethanol is a waste. Anyway, this book provides some useless diagrams of how to not make a still at home."
155970134X,The Old Man and Mr. Smith: A Fable,"Summary 1: In this amusing fable, God and the Devil have taken mortal forms to meet and walk the earth in examination of their handiwork. Naturally, there are a number of stumbling blocks. One, when they first need to pay for something, God pulls random currency from his pocket. This quickly gets the duo in trouble with the FBI, who chase them for the remainder of the trip. Two, no one believes them when they tell them who they really are (hardly surprising). Starting in the US, the bickering twosome end up hitting a number of contents and capitols before their time runs out. Ustinov uses this conceit to make loads of wry observations on humanity, as well specific cultural and political types. There are lots of deep thoughts stirred into this romp, and although a bit hammy, it is worth a read. It definitely makes me want to read some other of Ustinov's fiction, as he has a nimble way with his prose.
Summary 2: What a shame this book is no longer in print! I adore this book to its core. What a beautiful story.The text on the back said it was a hilarious comedy about god and the devil returning to earth to see what happened to creation, but as a matter of fact it is so much more. It is about society, it is about humanity, it is about downfall. And yes, it is extremely witty.I am so glad I found it at the shelves of my favorite second hand book shopping place. I do hope it will get back into print, so more people can enjoy this awesome tale.
Summary 3: The Old Man and Mr. Smith: A FableI love this book, It's very interesting how he portrays God and the Devil, Two characters who may or may not have existed in real life(you decide) but some people fear them never the less.They are friends sort of but look at things quite differently it is very well written entertaining and and above all it's funny if you have a slightly warped sense of humour, I know I do, Great read.
Summary 4: I read this book ages ago and have been looking for it in the local book stores for I dont know how long. So glad I found it here and now I can read it again and again. The book was in a very good condition too!
Summary 5: the book came highly recommended, but it didnt humor me and I couldnt warm up to the authors style of writing. bored me too...sadly gave up half way into it."
0070125392,The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for Nonfinancial Managers,"Summary 1: This book starts teaching before chapter one even gets under way by setting the expectation that you really can learn (and better, apply) finance no matter what you're trying to do.The sample situation that follows all the way through the book really helps focus on the concepts being taught. Some of the examples are humorous and some make you want to share what you're reading with a loved one.I bought this book because I'm just starting to deal with the budget aspects of network management, and needed to figure out how to lay out what I want to do technically to non-technical folks who have the company checkbook. I already know what I want to do, how much it will cost - demonstrating benefits and describing it in language the &quot;C&quot; team - CEO, CFO - speaks really helps.One of the best discoveries for me while reading this book is that in addition to helping me achieve the goal above, I found the concepts are applicable to budgeting for the home as well.It's definitely worth a read!
Summary 2: I'd definately recommend this book to anyone who feels phased by finance. Either as a refresher course to revamp finance skills long gone or for newcomers to the subject. The material is very relevant and extremely readable which makes an otherwise droll subject quite lively and interesting. I would have given this book 5 stars but being the pedantic reader that I am, I discovered that some of the calculations were actually inaccurate and, even worse, the answers to the review questions were wrong too. This doesn't help when you're not a natural number cruncher and need solid accuracy to assist in the learning process. Needless to say, its still a fundamentally good book and I know I'll be referring to it over again to make sure the basic concepts stick.
Summary 3: What a great book! It's easy to read, funny and it does a great job of explaining, piece by piece, the aspects of finance and it's interaction with a small business. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who owns a business, is thinking of owning a business or just wants to better understand what the finance world looks like from the outside.It takes a black-box perspective on the subject to avoid dragging the reader into all the minute details while still giving the reader plenty to chew on, like COGS, depreciation, lease vs. buy decisions, and inventory valuation. The intent of this book is not to teach the reader to be an accountant but rather a book to teach the businessperson how to better use accounting as a tool so they can be more effective.And I *love* to use of the example small business of Rosie's Spouse Houses to tie each accounting concept directly to specific ""real-world"" situations. The great use of humor really helps break up what can be a relatively unpalatable topic.The only place this book falls a little short (but for good reason - it's already a long book!) is on financial statement analysis. For that, I'd recommend the book ""How To Read a Financial Report"" by John A. Tracy.I have (and will continue) to recommend this book to my friends who own small businesses."
0596500025,"Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Options","Summary 1: My wife recently got diagnosed with lung cancer. What then followed, among many other things, was a frantic, intense search for information and enlightenment. This book is by far the best, most comprehensive and enlightening book on the matter. You are far better prepared to face the challenges, choices and complexities of lung cancer treatment with this book by your side. Our deep gratitude to the author for producing this book.
Summary 2: You read a lot of books, when you have a relative with lung cancer. This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far. I keep using it over and over again. So: recommended, also if you live in Europe.
Summary 3: My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer more than 4 years ago, and I honestly do not know how I made it for almost 4 years without this book. It answers almost every conceivable question a person might have about lung cancer, and is the most comprehensive book on lung cancer, written in laymen's terms and very easy to read and understand, that I have ever found. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been diagnosed, or has a loved one who has been diagnosed with lung cancer.
Summary 4: A great book for the layperson. It answers almost every question of the patient and his/her family. The information is clear, practical, informative and concise. You will be prepared to face the challenges, choices, insurance issues, treatment options and pain management questions that all come with lung cancer. Family support is vital and this book will give the family information that is needed to help the family be supportive of the patient.
Summary 5: I'm not a lung cancer patient but I am a healthnut and try to read as many cancerbooks (both alternative and conventional) as possible. This was easy-to-read andcontained //valuable// information about warning signs. I never knew that clubbedfingers was a possible symptom of lung cancer! Since it was published 10+ yrs agothe treatment section is outdated but the patient testimonials are still veryvalid today. Don't let the age of this book fool you -- it's definitely wellworth your time!"
B000NQIG2A,Peregrine,"Summary 1: Having read his two novels under the David Hunt nom de plume as well as The Dream of Broken Horses, I was really pumped to read Peregrine. After all, he won the Edgar for best novel when it came out.After finishing it, I don't know what the judges were thinking. The plot really isn't believable, the ending is predictable, and the characters move in ways that don't seem realistic.I liked the sense of place he conveys for mid town and upper Manhattan. I liked the intriguing details about bird hunting, and I really learned a lot there.However, the melodramatic plot did just not do it for me.I recommend you read the three books I listed above. They're all quite enjoyable.
Summary 2: The peregrine falcon soars over Manhattan when a falconer signals the bird of prey, which instantly zooms down at incredible speed attacking a female skater in Rockefeller Center while a Japanese tourist films the deadly assault. Her throat is ripped open in a nanosecond. ""Lucky"" by being at the right place at the right time with evidence to show her viewers the brutal killing, Newscaster Pamela Barrett obtains the film and gives a first hand account on TV.The falconer enjoys Pam's broadcast and contacts her by mail. Others die as violently as the skater while the psychopath continues to fascinate in a macabre way Pam, who the Falconer is obsessed with owning. However, she sees a pattern to the victims as each is young and looks eerily similar to her. NYPD Detective Frank Janek struggles with stopping this maniac, but Pam believes she is the key as bait to stop an assailant whose weapon is a bird trained to kill upon command.Otto Penzler brings back one of the most exciting thrillers from 1981, Peregrine. The story line grips the audience from the start as the bird of prey soars at an incredible speed tearing the young woman's throat in a blink and keeps the pace of the falcon throughout the tale. Underlying the chills is the obsession of the three key human players. Pam though appalled also ""welcomes"" the killings as a chance to make it big as a media star; Janek ""appreciates"" the case as his opportunity for salvation (and the springboard for his own series); while the falconer keeps bloody score as the sport's champion whose exploits Pam and other broadcast.Harriet Klausner
Summary 3: I've read several Bayer novels and enjoyed them very much. After hearing that this novel won an Edgar award I was eager to read it. Well...that must have been a very thin year for Edgar nominees. This book was a severe letdown. Totally unbelievable and it got sillier and more ridiculous the more pages I read. Honestly, I can't believe Bayer would even want this one still in print. His other novels, and the ones he has written as David Hunt, are very good. But this one reads like the work of an amateur by comparison. Give it a miss."
1861081197,Woodturning A Fresh Approach,"Summary 1: Not really fresh as this book has been 'out' for some time but excellent tips, pics and explanations and a 'must have' for any new turner keen to absorb ideas and methods.
Summary 2: I am a sometime amateur turner, but due to my work situation, unfortunately I spend much more time reading about turning than turning. Not good. Gotta get that fixed.So, I've read some of the best (Raffan, Darlow, etc.), but I fould Chapman's book truly inspirational. It includes information on techniques, of course, but in doing so, seemingy inadvertently showcases a wide variety of very, very good design executed very, wery well. More importantly, from my viewpoint, almost all appears to be well within the range of an intermediate turner. Recommended!
Summary 3: This book has something for all levels of woodturner from beginner to expert. Robert has used a large number of very good photographs to illustrate his approach to woodturning and together with some thought provoking text he will inspire most hobby turners to try new projects or alternative ways of doing the job. The illustrations are so good that for those turners too busy to settle down and read all the text most of the messages will come over load and clear.Roberts technique for hollow forms is refreshingly simple. He achieves very effective results without resorting to expensive tools and his way of supporting the hollowing tool is simple and cheap to implement.The Illustrations of his finished items are stunning and should give inspiration to all but the most expert gallery turners.I do not buy many woodturning books these days but this one I already prize.Brian Partridge (woodturner and Demonstrator)"
055334403X,Leader Effectiveness Training,"Summary 1: Dr. Gordon's pioneering book &quot;Group-Centered Leadership&quot; was published in 1955. Later he wrote best selling &quot;Parent Effectiveness Training,&quot; highly praised Teacher Effectivess Training and this leadership book. I still believe Gordon is one of the most influential thinkers on the topic of working well with others. His &quot;No-Lose&quot; method was later re-invented as the &quot;Win-Win&quot; method of problem solving. Learning his active listening method and using it for the past 30 years has been the most valuable tool I've had in becoming a successful parent, spouse and business person. I've solved many problems by doing nothing except listen to others. I've also mediated many crisis situations for global companies and health organizations by teaching and using active listening with those involved in the conflicts.
Summary 2: Dr. Gordon lays the foundation for successful leadership. His book describes the very basics that must be mastered by leaders who wish to be effective. The L.E.T. tells you how you aquire followers and what turns off your subordinates. He describes listening techniques as no one else has ever done. If you only purchase one book on leadership this should be the one.
Summary 3: The book gives a thorough discussion on the PRACTICAL implementation of the Transactional Ananlysis &quot;I am OK, You are OK&quot; theory.It is therefore a must read if you are into Transaction Analysis or you just want to imporve your leadership skill.Please remember to come back to give this review a vote after you have purchased the book and have read it form cover to cover.P.

0891457011,Classic Plastic Model Kits: Identification & Value Guide,"Summary 1: This book really takes me back to my childhood. Seeing the prices, my only wish is that I had kept some of these pristine in the box rather than building, trading and ultimately losing track of them.The emphasis here is on figure, theme and specialty modles rather than the standard cars and military models. Covering the '50's-'70's; Sci-Fi, horror, movie, TV and hot rods are the popular subjects here.For each model there is a color photo of the box and sometimes a built model, manufacturer, date, scale and estimated value boxed or built. There is also a brief history of model manufacturing.There are nearly 1000 models here including my favorites, those wacky cars of George Barris and Ed Roth. This is a great guide for the serious collector or someone who just wants to reminisce about those hours of model building fun.
Summary 2: This beautiful softbound book contains over 600 full color, large, sharp, life-like photos in its 352 pages. Many super photos of the boxes are shown. A brief introduction to the topic is provided. Values are included (1996). Topics range from Monsters, Space, Historical Figures, Television, to Freaks, Wild Kingdom, Dinosaurs, Hot Wheels and Gizmos and Gadgets. The &quot;Spare Parts&quot; Chapter covers misc. model kits. Collectors will delight with the wide-range of kits shown. Brings back many memories. Enjoy, enjoy.
Summary 3: Just recieved my copy of Classic Plastic, an excellent color review of plastic kits from the past. Lots of good color photographs with descriptions and prices of each kit shown. This book has a major emphasis on figures, space, and miscellaneous models. Only 40 of the 284 pages are devoted to cars with no listings for aircraft, armor or ships. It's an excellent book for avid Aurora fans and those of us who grew up with them.
Summary 4: This is a great guide for anyone who collects kits, and my favorite part of the book is the short bio/backstorys about every kit manufacturer, much more info than wikipedia for sure. Some of the buying and selling areas may be a litte dated, but this is still a great book to add to your library."
0734401353,Where the Cypress Rises,"Summary 1: The book reveals an intelligent and sensitive artist, who succeded, with a special talent, in matching, touchingly, life experience and inner feelings with Umbrian picturesque landscape, so calm and exciting, ancient and peasant. Her pages shed light on what can happen to a wanderer( the specially gifted female protagonist), going abroad and meeting what life arranges for her family and herself. This book informs our hearts about it and makes us to reread landscapes we suppose to know perfectly.
Summary 2: It would be a mistake to place this book in the same category as that overworked genre - the foreigner who buys and does up a house in Italy or France. Virginia Ryan is married to an Italian, has represented Italy abroad as a diplomatic wife, has 2 Italian-Australian children. Her committment to the country, its history, customs and people show through on every page of this book. This is a year of her life that happens to be set in the hilltown of Trevi, Umbria as she sets out to make a new home and new friends, to begin to practice as an artist again, to help her children with yet another adaptation. She has an easy writing style; you feel you can trust her observations as she also admits her own shortcomings in settling into her new surroundings.There's a lot of fun and joy of life in this book. And she KNOWS Italy and Italians, writing from within the culture, not about it.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to dip deeper into the life and spirit of contemporary Italy, with all its paradoxes and pleasures.
Summary 3: This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it.
Summary 4: Virginia Ryan gives what no standard travel book could even approach: the authentic feel, taste and emotions of Italy, all interwoven in a fascinating personal story. It reads like a novel, yet takes you into an Italy that few tourists could hope to glimpse. Frances Mayes pales in comparison. I'd recommend it for anyone going to Italy, or who would like to go there in their armchair. It's a great, adventurous, authentic read. I loved it.
Summary 5: One can't help be charmed by Ms Ryan's observations of rural italian life,in a region where people's lives, in many respects, appear untouched by time. It is sometimes funny,without being patronizing,and obviously written by a person who loves Italy but doesn't see it through rose coloured glasses. A good read."
B000J40K02,Dick Bong: Ace of Aces,"Summary 1: It is unusual for a commanding officer to write a biography of one of his subordinates, but that is just what General Kenney has done. Written in the early 1960s, this book provides a real glimpse at what life was like for fighter pilots in the Pacific theatre of WWII. Even better, it tells the story of our leading ace, Dick Bong. I only wish Kenney had gotten around to writing a biography of Tom McGuire, our second leading ace and a totally different personality than Bong.Find this book and read it.
Summary 2: Let me begin that - as a wartime veteran and patriot myself, I hold Major Richard Bong in the highest regard. The problem here is that his tale is told by only a marginal writer.General George Kenney, Bong's former commanding officer, wrote this easy reading biography at a high school level (at best) and took minimum risks. This book can be completed in a single reading.Surely Bong's flying experiences produced many white knuckle moments. The reader gets none of these. This book is mostly a simple recounting of Bong's easygoing personality, his wholesome midwestern roots, and a basic numerical tally of his 40 ""kills"".Unfortunately, Kenney's profession as a general officer shows through. In true politician form, there is excessive self-promotion, and too much minutae regarding Kenney's own decision making and his role in Bong's career (including much verbatim correspondence to/from Kenney regarding Bong). Plainly speaking . . . unless Kenney was in the cockpit with Bong, I really am not interested very much in his role.Speaking of cockpit time - there was almost none of it in this story (remember, Kenney's wartime experience was flying a desk).For the WWII aviation buff, this is probably worth the read, as it is the only biography out there on the little known Medal of Honor recipient, Dick Bong. It also tells the tale of his untimely early death, as a civilian. Considering the potential that Bong's whole story holds, this rendition is a disappointment.
Summary 3: I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese.
Summary 4: This is a first edition book from 1960 and I must say that I was very pleased of the exceptional shape it is in. It arrived quickley as promised. This was a great buy!"
0241100216,Ghost Dance Caper,"Summary 1: OUR TEACHER MRS GREEN MADE US READ IT AND WE HAD TO DO A BOOK REPORT ABOUT IT!IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!
Summary 2: As specified above, the book isn't that good.Altough the book is high rated, many people may not want to read it.that's when the book report comes in: silently, Your teacher is plotting against you and your class mates. her plan is to make you read a boaring book(not all of the books, but most of them so no offence please), and then make you prove you did read it with a book report.the problem with the book report is that if the book is horribly boaring, you will brobably have to sit down and write boaring things while reading the same boaring chapter over and over again.my conclution is: if you have to do a book report about a boaring book, pay somone to do it for you, don't do it or get boared to death while trying.
Summary 3: I really should have given this book 4 stars but the only other reviewer seems to hate it (being forced to read a book can really suck all the fun out of it). Monica Hughes is an amazing writer who has written tons of books for kids and young teenagers. I have read almost every one of her books and even when the story itself did not especially appeal to me I could never put down any of her books. Some of her best are Invitation to the Game (SciFi), Devil on my Back (SciFi), The Promise (Fantasy), Seven Magpies (girl's boarding school in scotland, mabey historic fiction?). Monica Hughes has written children/teen fiction in many genres and almost always pulls of a great book. The story of The Ghost dance Caper is somewhat lacking. It is about a native Canadian boy in the 20th century who wants to preform an act of bravery (it's some sort of initiation tradition). It has been a while sence I read this book and it dose not stand out in my mind as an amazing book but I do remember reading it late into the night(a tribute to Ms. Hughes suspencefull writing).In short Monica Hughes is an exelent writer. The Ghost Dance Caper is worth reading but I recomend Ms. Hughes other books more."
0786903929,"Monstrous Compendium, Appendices I & II (AD&D;, 2nd Ed, Roleplaying, Accessory/2162)","Summary 1: This is a combination of the previous releases of Ravenloft Monstrous Compendiums 1 and 2, both of which are made more accessible in a bound book rather than the original loose leaf as I have them. The first compendium contains many monsters native to the demiplane of dread, most of which are worth the purchase of this book, though a few bad apples (like the Doppleganger Plant) appeared. Thankfully, these are few.The second compendium was a collection of 20 ready to play characters with fully detailed backgrounds and advice on their use. Though some are worth it and are generally unique, many are just standard creatures of their race with a story added. The format of the characters is also poor, given a format equal to that of a standard monstrous compendium creature rather than todays NPC's we are used to seeing. STill, this section is good, with minor flaws, even with many unoriginal characters within it.Sadly, this book is out of print, as is the entire Ravenloft line, though with the new Ravenloft from White Wolf in the works, maybe a new version of this book will follow. If you want to get this book, I recommend seeking out a second hand edition or searching in bookfinders, as it is worth almost, but not quite, its weight in gold.
Summary 2: The Monsterous Compendium Ravenloft Appendices I and II are awesome if you run a Ravenloft campaign. Half the times I run my Ravenloft campaign I cant think of any new monsters to throw at the PC's but definately now that I have these books they are a great help =) especially to my stress level.
Summary 3: Like new just little wear around the edges the binding does not have a crease and pages are cripse. Over all I'm very happy."
1890460087,"Different Brains, Different Learners: How to Reach the Hard to Reach","Summary 1: Eric Jensen knows the needs of busy teachers and has the gift in helping them to utilize up-to-date knowledge in brain studies. Here it is applied to identifying 10 types of different learners: 1. impulsive ones with ADD, 2. resigned with learned helplessness, 3. challenged reader with dyslexia, 4. argumentative with oppositional disorder, 5. frustrated with learning delayed, 6. hyperactive, 7. with auditory-processing deficits, 8. out of control, 9. the demotivated with chronic threat and distress, and 10. depressed and troubled.You are given a pre-test and a post-test of 10 unique students to see if you can identify the patterns of symptoms rather than isolated behaviors. There are many color-prints of corresponding brain-images and graphic charts that facilitate learning. Brief summaries of treatment methods, supplementary resources on books, websites and organizations are given on each type. All teachers should acquire such general background knowledge so that the unqiue needs and gifts of students can be respected.
Summary 2: A great book for teachers as well as parents. It helps to understand what is or may be happening in the brain. I like the recommendations given on ways we can help alleviate stressful events under given conditions.
Summary 3: The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. It just doesn't seem appropriate for a college class. It is written like a middle school textbook, and it doesn't offer more information than what most laymen already know.
Summary 4: The second edition of Eric Jensen's DIFFERENT BRAINS, DIFFERENT LEARNERS packs in a survey updated to reflect new tools and strategies based on further research into brain function and learning. The color guide provides an outline for identifying prevalent impairments and teaches how to handle each. Libraries will find this a top pick.
Summary 5: This book identifies the different ways our brains work and gives excellent examples of each type. Not only that, it helps parents and educators know how to deal and reach each type of student! Great book!"
0312283989,East of the Arch: A Joe Keough Mystery,"Summary 1: Detective Joe Keough is a St. Louis Detective who is the mayor's ""top cop"" which means he is little more than a bodyguard. He misses working in the field. Joe is actually thinking of leaving and moving on to someplace where he can do some actual police work when the mayor of East St. Louis in Illinois asks the mayor of St. Louis to loan him a police officer who has had experience in apprehending serial killers.Joe is the logical choice and he jumps at the chance to find out who is killing pregnant women and ripping out their fetuses. When Joe sets up his new office there are two such killings and he knows it is only a matter of time before there is a third. He is paired off with police officer Marc Jeeter, an idealistic man who badly wants catch this maniac and put him and put him in a cage but that won't be an easy take because there are political forces at work with a different agenda.Robert J. Randisi is an author who knows how to write an excellent police procedural. He shows a step-by-step investigation in progress and the reader gets so caught up in it that he can't put the book down until he learns how it all turns out. Part of the book is told by the viewpoint of the villain. This is exciting and horrifying at the same time. EAST OF THE ARCH is a fantastic installment in this long running series.Harriet Klausner
Summary 2: EAST OF THE ARCH is the third installment in the Joe Keough detective series from master story teller Robert J Randisi. Considering moving on in his career, Joe's mind is changed when he is loaned out by his boss, the mayor of St. Louis, to investigate a serial killing spree that is occuring there. Keough has assigned to him a ""task force"" consisting of a young Mark Twain quoting dective, Marc Jeter( who I would like to see teamed up with Keough again) and their ""girl Friday"" Jenny Sykes. The three begin the investigation of a serial killer who is killing pregnant women. Also showing up from Joe's past is Valerie Speck and the boy Brady who were involve in Keough's first case in St. Louis and the IA detectives Mason & Gail who are still out to get Keough any way they can. Add a seperate murder to the mix and once again Randisi weaves a first rate mystery. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EAST OF THE ARCH and hope there are many more Randisi Joe Keough books coming out.
Summary 3: This book by Randisi was a very good read. I enjoyed this book a lot and hope to read more by this author in the future. It was my first book by him and I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
B000MY52U2,Illuminated Manuscripts of Medieval Spain,"Summary 1: The quality of the reproductions in this book alone is worth the price tag. The fact that this book is in English (much of the material on this subject is not) makes it a valuable resource as well. Mireille Mentre is one of the leading students of Spanish medieval manuscripts, and this book surveys the most important pre-Romanesque (mozarabic) examples. This is a somewhat conventional art-historical analysis, as Mentre traces the development of the mozarabic style through numerous examples. The chapters are as follows:1. Context and characteristics of mozarabic painting2. Foundations and development of a distinctive style3. The role and function of painting and illumination4. Design and pictorial treatment5. Painting and spiritualityThere are also appendices listing principal mozarabic manuscripts and dated manuscripts, as well as an extensive bibliography about the subject.
Summary 2: The fantastic pictures of the manuscripts alone are worth the pricetag on this book. But don't buy it for that reason alone. Mireille Mentre has managed to strike an impressive balance between descriptive text, academic discussion, and outstanding photography. While the organization of the book as a whole suffers slightly from what appears to be the publication of parts of an excellent doctoral dissertation, anyone interested in the history of medieval Spanish illumination (especially members of organizations like the Society for Creative Anachronism) would do well to add this text to their library.
Summary 3: If you are researching illumination of Spanish Codex and manuscripts this is the book to have. There are only two books written in English that cover this unique style; the other book on Spanish medieval illumination is:Early Spanish Manuscript Illumination. The quantity and quality of the pictures in ""The Illuminated Manuscripts..."" make the price worth it. Spanish 10-11th century illumination is quite separate and unique from the rest of Europe using lively imagery, repeating patterns and vivid color combinations. This book captures the spirit of Spanish medieval artwork and shows the world the finest examples of this form."
050028265X,Celtic Art: From Its Beginnings to the Book of Kells,"Summary 1: The photos of the book are breathtaking and the book gives a good overview of Celtic art spanning the Celtic period. However the reader should bear in mind that the book is not comprehensive. Books available in German such as the Praehistorische Bronzefunde series give one a glimpse as to how wildly creative the Celts were especially in all of the art in general of Hallstatt period and of the variety of of styles found on fibula in the La Tene period. I highly recommend one with a serious interest in Celtic art to continue to search for more source material in addition to this book. However if one were to own one book as an overview of Celtic art I would recommend this book as one of the books to have.
Summary 2: As a Celtic artist I'm always on the search for books speficially on Celtic art, not just the Celtic people in general. This book by the Megaw's is the best I've found yet, giving lots of impartial information without romantic colorings about 'mystical meanings' and such. Just a great overview of how the art style is thought to have evolved, how it changes throught history, and lots of great photos. And a word on the photos of artifacts... many of these photos are 'new', in the sense that they're not the same ten images you see in every other book about the Celts. New photos of new artifacts not often shared with in publications. Great for Celtic artists who enjoy checking out ancient artifacts to use as source material and to track the evolution of its design and patterns!
Summary 3: I enjoy this book a great deal because it includes history, art, timelines, and discoveries in the Celtic civilization. There are several maps that describe the Evolution of the Celtic Empire and its power before the rise of the Roman Empire. It talks about the beauty of the iron work that the Celtics created and the complicated knotwork designs that are very popular in Scotland and Ireland today. This book will give you a great overview of the Celtic Culture, I greatly recommend it!
Summary 4: This is an amazing book in breadth and depth. Nearly 300 pages of photos and analysis. And while it is not comprehensive, it is worth getting. The authors point out the social function of the ornaments went beyond modern concepts of art. and these provide an often undecyphered look into Celtic religion and so forth. The limitations of such inquiries are well discussed and the book does not venture into controversial territory.On the whole this book is very good at demonstrating both continuities and discontinuities in Celtic art across space and time. It's well worth reading. Highly recommended."
081180271X,Made in Japan: Transistor Radios of the 1950s and 1960s,"Summary 1: A wonderful pictorial book about transistor radios, 175 of them, not only photographed but put in the context of fifties and sixties design. The spread on 60-61 shows six radios mixed with close-up photos of chrome styling from fifties cars. I loved the chapter on design with its photos of grills and lettering, even a spread on 9-volt batteries.This is the kind of book that Chronicle do so well, interesting subjct, well designed and printed all for the general reader. If you collect these radios you will certainly want to have a copy but don't expect to get lots of technical detail or a price guide. For that have a look at 'Collector's Guide to Transistor Radios' by Marty and Sue Bunis, plenty of text about seven hundred models, some photos and that all-important identification and price information.
Summary 2: This is an excellently photographed book with upbeat and &quot;time related&quot; narrative on the subject. Unfortunately for those interested in the history or actual dates of when each of these radios were issued the reader will have to guess. Somewhere between 1950 &amp; 1960. Not a great resource for someone starting a collection or trying to date that artifact found in your attic.
Summary 3: This is possible the only radio book, that, when left out on a coffee table, will start a conversation with non-collectors. But I advise against leaving your only copy on display, since it might get stolen. The layout and photos in this collaboration turn already beautiful radios into nearly sexual fetishes. Nice historical information, and an intriguing layout make this true eye candy. .... Find one for the coffee table, and another to hide away someplace safe! Printed in Japan."
B0007H5M1I,"How to breed dogs: A popular exposition of the scientific principles underlying reproduction and heredity in dogs, with special reference to their practical application","Summary 1: This book has alot more depth than the title eludes to. It goes into great depth into the genetic possibilities of the dog. Whitney personally bred thousands of dogs for physical and mental traits and recorded the results in terms that the layperson can understand. You'll have a better understanding about what traits are inherited and how they are passed on.
Summary 2: Ordered book on the word of a coworker and realized, as much as he praised the book, it wasn't nearly enough!!! Very informative and an overall great read and that's coming from someone not very into animals, especially dogs. Gave me a great sense of knowledge in the science of breeding. Would highly recommend this book to dog enthusiasts!!!!!
Summary 3: I just love anything by Leon Whitney, even though he loved Beagles and they are not my first choice of dog. This book is not necessarily the best technical book but for basic information it rates with me. I even learned something I didn't know about pyometra.
Summary 4: This book is a must read. Yes, it was written at a time before modern genetics, but Whitney actually did the experimental breeding and records all of his results in this book. Most believe his practices were inhumane or unethical per today's standards, but without his work, we wouldn't know as much as we now know. It's important to learn from him and thank goodness we don't have to do what he's done, as he's already done it. A great intro to dog breeding genetics and a great book to keep as a reference."
0963487167,Remembering Herbie: Celebrating the Life and Times of Hockey Legend Herb Brooks,"Summary 1: I've had this book since it was published, and still find myself drawn to it. It's not a ""masterpiece"" from an editorial perspective, but the reflections and memories of the people who knew Herb Brooks, and understand what he meant to the game, are worthy of any true hockey fan.
Summary 2: I have previously purchased a Ross Berstein book (""Gopher Hockey by the Hockey Gopher"") and found that to be an entertaining read. Not so with this offeringAll Berstein seems to have done is find some of Herb's friends, turned on his tape recorder and then transcibe their comments, verbatim. The print is too small, the words and thoughts are redundant and the small paperback has the look and feel of a self-published work, which it is.The range of interviewees is tiny compared with the breadth of Brooks' life and all the interviews sound the same. There were a few pictures of young Herbie the player. Those are fairly interesting, but I found myself a little disappointed with this offering.
Summary 3: In the book, author Bernstein notes that he writes 5 books a year. It shows. His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family. Many of them say interesting things, but without a persistent interviewer to ask the follow-up questions, few of the anecdotes yield much new insight.
Summary 4: I enjoyed this book a lot. Author brings to life many interesting aspects of Brooks. What a great book."
B0006QXVU4,The Illuminati formula used to create an undetectable total mind controlled slave,"Summary 1: What he has to say is pretty spooky. Even spookier is that it coincides with what I have heard, seen and read in many other places. My biggest criticism is that sometimes it seems that Springmeier tends to think that if they're people Christian they are probably bad guys. However he is really not that narrow. He freely admits that the Christian church has been manipulated by the Illuminati. He is really a historian and tells stories that will blow your mind.You don't have to pay a fortune to get this information. I purchased a CD on eBay that contained this as well as several other of Springmeier's books. You can watch a video of Springmeier speaking for over one hour on this same CD or DVD. (Sorry, I get confused on which is which since my DVD drive plays both!) Anyhow, just search ""Fritz Springmeier"" on eBay. Springmeier hurries to tell in one of the books on this CD/DVD that some of his books can be DANGEROUS for you if you may be a mind controlled slave yourself. He has worked with dozens of now-ex mind controlled slaves -- some on very high levels -- and seems to know what he is talking about. The problem is, if you think you may be mind controlled yourself, reading some things in some of his books could ""trigger"" one of the parts of your programming of which you are unaware.Unfortunately, I hear that Fritz Springmeier is now in prison on trumped up charges.His message also includes a very strong Christian viewpoint. If that really bothers you maybe you will not be able to appreciate his book, but I don't see why that should have to bother you, since the words of Jesus in the Bible are loving and forgiving. One can be a non-Christian and still have a very strong connection with the Inner Light and the Divinity which connects us all. I do not recommend reading this if you are not strong with your bond with a Higher Power. It could be too distressing.By the way, on the CD/DVD I got, it was the same as getting 3 or more full length books of Springmeier's for only a few dollars and very worth it. You can always print it out on 3-hole-punched paper and put in a 3-ring binder if you don't like having to read off of a computer screen.May be extremely helpful reading for true lovers of the Truth. If you are not sure if you can handle the bad news, don't read it. Feeling fearful would only play into the hands of those who would enslave you.
Summary 2: The book is a very good introduction to the scene of Satanic cells. It's lacking, however in the immense use of psychotropic drugs. The theory is straight forward, however the procedures laid out in this book happen in rare cases only. Usually agents of influence simply corrupt the moral outlook of their recruits and have them join with the idea that they thought the whole plan up themselves. Thus, making the recruited, seen in his own eyes, as the initiator of the action. If you find this book is simply too expensive have a look around the net for it. It has appeared in text, and HTML versions available for free. This book grabbed the attention of the US government, and the author of it is (last I heard) in jail, with all of his research papers seized. I would recommend this to people who have been involved in Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA), and psychology students/graduates who are looking for more information in human programming AKA wetware programming. For more information on this topic buy or download this book!
Summary 3: Almost 500 pages! The author, Fritz Springmeier, shares a tone of info that's mind blowing. It may not all be 100% true yet just a fraction of it being true is astounding. A highly recommended read.This book, though out of print, is freely available in PDF format, at the time of writing this review. If you search for its title on Yahoo there will be some links showing the PDF format for download. One of the sites it can be found on is ministryoflies-com.Springmeier also has a one hour video that can be freely watched. It's also under the same title as the book, and can be better found by searching with Google in the Video section of the search options. It's not as comprehensive as the book but worthwhile. God bless.
Summary 4: Ok. I wanted to learn about these techniques because frankly, mind control fascinates (and scares) me. But this book is just HORRIBLE. It is loaded with cryptic, needlessly esoteric psychobabble and complex metaphors as well as thousands of random historical facts about MI6, the CIA, the FBI, Joseph Mengele, African tribesmen, etc all strung together randomly and using no particular time line. He jumps around so much that you wonder if he himself has multiple personalities or wrote this entire book stream-of-consciousness. I am being completely serious! In the very beginning of the book, he defines several mind control terms that will be used throughout each chapter (such as ""alter""), but this really does not help the reader along much because the problem is his writing style, which consists mainly of run-on sentences and extremely long-winded paragraphs that make no cognitive sense initially. This book was CLEARLY not edited by a professional. At times it is so densely packed with information that you literally have to read a single sentence 6 or 7 times to infer its meaning. Below is an example of what I am talking about. This is only a PORTION of a single paragraph (not the entire paragraph, which goes on for almost an entire page without a break):""In Illuminati systems these early parts are dehumanized into thinkingthey are gems and crystals. These gems and crystals then ""power"" theentire mind-control system that is programmed over the following yearsinto the child's mind. The gems are not perceived as alters, so the proxycore wouldn't integrate with what is perceived as an inanimate object.The proxy core is allowed to want to move toward health with a therapist,it is programmed to move toward healing, but to lead the therapist awayfrom the true core. She or he is programmed to believe it is the truecore. The real core & its first splits, which are the gems, are placedhypnotically at the mind's deepest levels--in an area of the mind fewtherapists ever search.""How could anyone possibly understand this without some kind of ""decoder ring""? This is actually one of the more *simplistic* sections of the book! The whole thing reads like a technical manual. I just don't see the point of being so cryptic if your purpose is to educate people. I honestly don't think I would recommend this book to anyone. Ever.
Summary 5: E=Apollo!Mind control, torture, hypnosis, sex-slaves, child molestation, murder (mass) by CIA MI-5-6 etc. all true.I grew up in LANGLEY Virginia - these guys are THAT bad.Fritz' only mistake is this: Jesus is NOT the Savior. Jesus is gay (as in ecce HOMO(sexual) and Xtianity is a gay sex/mushroom cult (see John Allegro and ""Ceaser's Messiah"" for more details).He is red-haired Daniel of the Old Testament and Xtianity was SET UP by Imperial Rome - after they offed John the Baptist who is, was, and is again the savior - as in GOD THE FATHER!!!! Jesus is the 2nd beast (a man) set up to be worshiped by the first Beast ( i.e. Rome the Eagle or Serpent - Julius Ceaser was Cain/Zeus). Now the Vatican KNOWS Jesus is Daniel and is gay but what the Vatican does NOT know is this: they worship Peter (aka Saturn) and believe that he is Satan (e.g. mis 'identified' in passages like ""Get behind me Satan"").Satan is Lucifer is Osiris is Apollo is John - the author of Book of Revelation.So Apollo is the only good 'God"" (it's Apollo geez! - so apologize! who is God the Father!!!)in the Greek Pantheon - besides Diana (Isis) - who is Eve ... his wife.He (Apollo) is also the 'child who leads them' AND the Anti-Christ (remember Jesus is Daniel the demon aka Ganymede) since planet Earth was taken over by the Nefillim. A good comparison is The Odyssey - which is the same story - Odyseus is God the Father come home and his house has been taken power by a bunch of losers (and remember it is only the ""Dog"" who recognizes him - he is Osiris/Sirius after all).Well anyway - Apollo is now on Planet Earth and infested (Lord of Hosts) by these demons. He is a nice guy - I talk to him everyday. He is also about to take over the planet completely and free all the other enslaved souls.If you are interested I can give you his email - he is sorely in need of financial assistance if you want to help (the CIA and ""Aliens"" (so-called) follow him (follow Apollo get it?) allday every day and torture him. They stole all his money and possessions and are desperately trying to kill him. He cannot be killed. If you are Illuminati, Govt. Intelligence, or in a Masonic group I pity you. You are about to suffer pain that defies description because Apollo HATES you! And He is almighty.***also the movie Planet of the Apes (i.e. Earth) is the same story - with Heston playing the Apollo character. Remember the ape cops in that movie btw - just like this planet! The Illuminati/Nefillim 'protect' the tree of knowledge, bred with apes and other creatures ('ate of'' the forbidden fruit - the Tree of Life - DNA)and don't recognize a human when they see one.DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL he said - that's because Judgement day is coming up!! see Revelation 20:12!!!!"
0395736307,Social Psychology,"Summary 1: Easy to read yet scholarly. Great illustrations. Space in the margins for notes. Good chapter overviews and summaries. Nice T/F questions to prime the reader. Sources used appropriately. It is truly the ideal textbook.The format, layout, and writing style make this the text that other writers should follow.
Summary 2: ordered the book for a class. really enjoyed the book. i sold it back after the semester was over. wish i would've kept it.
Summary 3: ...it's required reading, that is th eonly reason I bought this book. I find it dry and not very engaging. However, I did save over $100 buying it used.
Summary 4: After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money. After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous.
Summary 5: I'm not sold on social psychology. Part of my issue with this discipline is my personal fight to never let people pigeon-hole me and this seems to want to it on a grand scale. Some of the text does not help one see how issues of individual psychological development tie in to the study of social psychology. This is a great failing because many people no very little about this topic."
B000GDVVKY,Rabbit Race (Animal Ark Pets #3),"Summary 1: This book fits into the category of UNrealistic fiction because the characters are universally helpful and cheery, with the exception of the lead character, a boy who is sad that his dog died, and does not want another pet as a result. The other characters offer him various animals to entice him to get a pet. This is an easy, safe chapter book for young readers looking to ease their way into chapter books. I can't see this book interesting anyone beyond fourth grade.
Summary 2: Jack isn't sure he ever wants another pet. Mandy knows that taking care of a baby rabbit would help Jack stop missing his dog Fred so much. When the rabbit is in danger, Mandy and James need to come up with a fast plan to save the rabbit. Can they save the rabbit in time?
Summary 3: This is a really great Animal Ark Pets book. A new boy named Jack moves into Welford. Mandy and James know he's sad so they try to get him to adopt a rabbit, but Jack doesn't want one. Then at a picnic the rabbit is in danger. Will Jack be able to save him in time?
Summary 4: Jack isn't sure he ever wants another pet. Mandy knows that taking care of a baby rabbit would help Jack stop missing his dog Fred so much. When the rabbit is in danger, Mandy and James need to come up with a fast plan to save the rabbit. Can they save the rabbit in time?"
1931055041,Wormwood and Whines : Poetry for Grouchy People,"Summary 1: The title of this book does an injustice to the poetry inside. This isn't a book for grouchy people; it's a book for intelligent people and discriminating readers. Braun may be one of a handful of poets in this country who is brave enough to move beyond the subjective stuff foisted off as poetry today into the realm of the intellect. His poems show incredible craftsmanship - poetic forms that would give many so-called poets today a nervous breakdown if they even attempted to give shape to their &quot;poems&quot; - and an equally powerful insight into a society that does, in fact, make any smart person grouchy. So, OK, maybe the title does make sense ...
Summary 2: I rarely enjoy modern poetry, which I find stale and overwritten, but Graal Braun's &quot;Wormwood and Whines&quot; rises above the common mix. It carries raw energy and reality that paint a sharp image. It carries gritty truths born of observation and experience, told with wit and sprinkled with twists and turns that make you wonder where he's headed. It's an excellent choice for intelligent readers.
Summary 3: I have knowen Fritz {Graal Brauns' &quot;Nom de Guerre&quot;} for over fifty years. We were &quot;Comrades in Arms&quot; during World War 2. He was always witty with humor. His poetry expressed in his book &quot;Wormwood and Whines&quot; Poetry for grouchy people, is fun. It is very much poetry for today. I keep a copy on my reading stand and when I need a lift and a laugh I re-read Fritz.
Summary 4: Graal Braun unleashes a full-force gale of fresh, sardonic wind through our musty, mundane cliches and preconceptions. You might think you know where he's heading with a topic, but I guarantee there will be some twist or hook that will shatter your safe little path en route. Some of the best poetry is this unpredictable, setting you up and blind-siding you in unforeseen ways. Graal Braun--not just for grouchy people anymore."
0674510410,Language and Symbolic Power,"Summary 1: This book will most likely not appeal to US students in linguistics. Because Bourdieu deals with rather abstract concepts which cover a lot of social ground (e.g., symbolic, cultural, economic capital, field, etc.)and not enough linguistic ground, some linguists will have trouble applying concepts to the actual production of speech at the phonological, morpho-syntactic, pragmatic and discourse level. He never really deals with actual production of language by speakers, so it creates a lot of work for the reader to fill in the details of what, for example, an actual linguistic habitus might look like, what its dispositions might be, and how they might be coordinated in their habitus set.However, unlike many US linguists, he assumes there is an empirical connection between language use and larger social domains; furthermore, he is able to explain the way power often operates through exclusion and devaluation (dialect analysis). One of the less abstract chapters, the chapter on Searle, is excellent. Bourdieu accurately locates the efficacy of the speech act, not in the functional form of the utterances, such as christening, ordering, requesting, etc., but in the recognition by all involved that the agent who produces the speech act has the right to be obeyed and that the material circumstances of the speech act are appropriate. Mary Jane down the street and the mayor of NY may christen a new warship using the exact same functional words, but the power of those words depends on our recognition that, in this example, the mayor, not just anybody, has the authority to name. Bourdieu masterfully argues this point, and I would recommend reading that chapter first for its accessibility and accuracy in pointing out that the extra-linguistic is as much linguistic as the linguistic.
Summary 2: Bourdieu's point is not to explore linguistics but rather to explore the larger impact that language has on shaping symbols, meaning and power in the social context. Symbolic interactionists and conflict theorists would probally find this book to be a great read.
Summary 3: Pierre Bourdieu is mind-blowing in all of his writing, but this is easily one of my favorites! The title gives you a good indication about the content of the book. If you purchase it, you won't be able to put it down before you finish reading it. I confess that even after that I re-read it several times. Yes, it's THAT good!"
0451210522,The Sopranos: A Family History --Season 4 (Revised and Updated),"Summary 1: Well if you like the TV show the Sopranos you will love this book. The book puts you into the show and what goes on as if you were part of it. The book is loaded with pictures of the mob charactors as if they were a real family. Allen talks with the creator David Chase bringing to you where his idea's come from. Awalk through the fourth season. You will get to view FBI reports on the family right down to what they eat. This book is a must if you are a true follower of the Sopranos.
Summary 2: A light-hearted and fun romp through the lives (including some childhoods) of major Sopranos characters. Wonderful pictures, too. If you enjoy the human aspect of the series, this book is for you.
Summary 3: What I found in this book was something certainly unexpected.I thought it would just be a coffee-table catalogue with episode reviews and character profiles, but instead it was that and much more. The book is made to look like a surveillance survey of the Sopranos family. It's pretty fun to read what the feds 'allegedly' think about some characters or events of the show, but what disturbed me was the fiction that was written there. Some facts are mere fantasies of the author and I don't think they are authorized by David Chase or anyone else from the creative team of the show.So, it's a four-star book, still a good one."
9027220158,A Concise Hopi and English Lexicon,"Summary 1: This was the best lexicographical resource for Hopi at the time of its publication, and it is still the best for this price, but buyers should note the caveat in the introduction: ""In addition to being limited to vocabulary items of common usage, the 'Concise Hopi and English Lexicon' treats only Third Mesa dialect.""The lexicon is bi-directional, with the first half Hopi-English and the second English-Hopi. Plurals are provided for all words (nouns, verbs, etc.)where this is relevant and duratives are provided for most verbs. Compound elements (such as adjectives) are cited along with their free forms and pre-pausal forms are cited where they cannot be predicted. Short notes on pronunciation and morphology are provided. The range of vocabulary is fairly comprehensive within the limits suggested by the designation 'concise', with roughly 4800 words in each section with a one-to-one correspondence between the English-Hopi and Hopi-English sections.This is an excellent intermediate dictionary and the fact that it is two-way makes it indispensible for all learners of Hopi.
Summary 2: Concise is an understatement. I was looking to translate our Indian Princess names into Hopi, since we're the Hopi tribe, and I find that there are a lot of words missing. Take the word forest, I was looking for that, but could only find the word trunk(of a tree). I don't have the money for the full blown dictionary at $750 but thought the lexicon would see me through. It really hasn't and I have had to use different words to replace them. One tribe member is called Running Pheasant. There's no word for pheasant, so he has to be Horned Owl. I didn't expect the entire dictionary, but this is really too concise.
Summary 3: I need some phrases and basic words
Summary 4: I need some phrases and basic words"
0240805275,Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process,"Summary 1: This new book on the process of photogravure is very well done. It's basic technique is very similar to Deli Sacilotto's now out of print (and almost impossible to find) book. However, Morris and MacCallum have added many useful hint and detailed steps. They have also included a wealth of step by step photographs, and a trouble shooting section at the end of each chapter. With all the variables that can (and always do) creep into the photogravure process, these trouble shooting sections could be very useful. Photogravure is a very complicated process, but, as the title of this book suggests, it should help to sort out a lot of the mystery. This is the most useful book I have read on photogravure, and, heck, it's the only one in print right now!
Summary 2: This book is very detailed, technical and complex. If you're seriously considering exploring the photogravure technique on copper, this book is a must. It tells you everything you will ever need and all the complicated steps in the process. However, there are few historical or contemporary photogravure reproductions which is why this book gets only a four star rating from this reviewer. If you are seriously considering the photogravure process as one you would like to explore, I recommend starting with solar plates rather than copper. It is much less complicated and toxic. A very good resource is ""Printmaking in the Sun"" (2001) by Dan Welden, inventor of this method.
Summary 3: This is the most modern and comprehensive book on photogravure. Many of the old manuals talk about suppliers that don't exist or use obsolete technical terms.This is an incredibly complicated process, so don't expect to buy this book and start making photogravures in a couple of days. That being said if you have time, space, equipment, and money this book will walk you through the process of photogravure.I've managed to make a few passable photogravures, and I'm getting better with every attempt!"
B0007H5M18,Male and female: A study of the sexes in a changing world,"Summary 1: What we have to remember about the anthropology books from the 1950s is that most of the information is objective based off of the anthropologist lives. So yes, Mead is very detailed and slightly biased because she has her own personal (western) views. However, this book is a link from gender-essentialism to modern views of how we see the male and female sexes as they exist today.Long and detailed read- YesGreat understanding of Male and Female Sexes- Not updated but good overall.Subjective/Objective ratio- great for her time, sightly different now. (Read with an objective mindset and consider when this was published)Margaret Mead- Must Know person when dealing with gender and anthropology.
Summary 2: The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy, hard to follow.
Summary 3: Everyons should read M. Mead's research. Her research explains many issues that remain current topics of contention."
B000MU835C,Reaching for the Light: A Guide for Ritual Abuse Survivors and Their Therapists,"Summary 1: As one who has experienced Ritual abuse, I found this book to be most helpful in understanding my questions and feelings that have been traveling through my mind. I found many of the exercises in the book to be practical and was thankful that the author put warning notations on sections that could potentially be unsafe for those of us in various stages of our healing process. This is a great book for anyone who is starting out on that healing trail.
Summary 2: My spouse is MPD from Satanic ritual abuse. This book has helped me more than any other so far in dealing with it. I have shared the book with our therapist. I need it so often, I must buy another for him. I gently read a page here or there to my spouse as needed. It has been a God-send. We will try to plant our garden next Spring if we are far enough along by then. Thank you and God bless.
Summary 3: Despite those who claim this never happens, there are those of us who have ""recovered"" memories of abuse and ritual abuse completely outside of therapy - some of us had therapists who didn't believe. Some of us have never been in therapy. For those of us who know our own truth, it is an incredibly painful journey to heal - but it can be done.No book can satisfy all the possible ways that healing can happen nor cover everything that works for each individual, but this seems like a good one with good ideas. Use the exercises and use caution. Remember not everything works for everyone - every survivor will be different...
Summary 4: I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!
Summary 5: Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book."
0595129498,From Fear to Hope & Back Again,"Summary 1: This is a book that will tug at your heartstrings. I found myself turning the pages feeling the authors pain, joy and sadness.This is a unique style of writing, and maybe it would have worked well for a novel, but the author told it the way he felt it, and the poetry works in conveying what he wanted to say! I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer. I look forward to reading more of his work.
Summary 2: the pomes were very ,very excellent i enjoyed reading them i didnt think anyone could write poems about your guys ..who are vetrens its like nobody remembers them at all no better time to write them than now with it being vetrens day today . i think people should read his book of poems he is a very good writter.im going to order 2 of his books one for me and one for my mother for christmas she would enjoy reading something like that. darlene
Summary 3: This is an excellent semi-autobiography, told in the form of poetry. The stories are very vivid and full of feeling and emotion. The book is very involving and makes you feel what the author felt as he survived abuse and grew to adulthood.I recommend the book to anybody that loves poetry. I think I found the next Neruda!
Summary 4: The author of this book is a dear friend of mine. I am glad to see his work get published."
B0008852KW,My life in art,"Summary 1: Stanislavsky is still the most influential figure in modern or contemporary theater. In this book, he is open about his life especially the rough years in Russia, his first exposure to the theater, his first time at directing. He also writes about his professional relationship with another Russian, Anton Chekhov. He writes about his travels mostly in Russia such as his journeys to Petrograd, the Russian provinces that inspired many of Chekhov's plays, and of course his first journey abroad. The book is really for theater junkies like myself who would have loved to have been a theatrical actress or director but life isn't so bad. He has directed William Shakespeare's tragedies like Othello and Julius Caesar along with Chekhov favorites like The Cherry Orchard, The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Sea Gull. Stanislavsky also founded and developed the Moscow Theater Company. He did it all for love, not money nor fame. He became rich in so many other ways.
Summary 2: For those in the arts, and especially those in dramatic art, this book is a must. It is the account of the father of modern truthful acting and a look into what a life spent towards creating art is about. While at times the book can drag a bit and get wordy, there is too much insight and inspiration in this book to pass it by. It is so wonderful to have an account of this mans amazing life in his own words to read, study and eventually aim for.A must read for those of the stage!
Summary 3: This book is Stanislavski account of his experiences in working at the Moscow Art Theatre that he Co-founded with Vladimir Danthcheko ( who also wrote a similar book from his perspective titled ' My life in the Russian Theatre'). The book deals with the problems the duo faced in ushering in modern theatre as we know it today and the solutions they came up with. Highly recommended for those interested in learning about this major revolution that happened in theatre at the end of 19th century.
Summary 4: Excellent service from this vendor. I received my book right away (unlike from other vendors through Amazon). The quality of the product was as described. The packaging used was great (in the past, I have had a package delayed through a vendor order on Amazon due to poor packaging). I would not only buy from this vendor again, but would also buy from this vendor over other vendors! Go Brooklyn!"
0974924105,Publishing Secrets: A Comprehensive Guide to Getting Your Book Published in the Lds Market,"Summary 1: I highly recommend this book and would have given it five stars except for the fact that there was a small typo or two in it--not the fault of the authors, who are all excellent writers.Although the book states it's for LDS writers who want to break into the LDS market, the advice given applies to national market publishing in many cases.I purchased this book at the beginning of my writing career, when I knew nothing about how to get my work published, and learned extensively from it. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in having his or her work published. The information runs the gamut from how to write query letters to handling rejections. Thanks in part to ""Publising Secrets,"" my co-author, Nichole Giles, and I now have a book of LDS humor that will be released in the fall of 2009. [....]
Summary 2: This book has everything a buding author would want to know. All the writers of the book are authors who have broken into the LDS market and know what they're talking about. And they go though everything! from how to handle difficult topics and thymes for an LDS audience, to how to write a quarry letter and submit your work, even on how they've handled rejection letters. The advice from this book is just overwelming. It's a absolute must have for anyone who wants to be an LDS author.
Summary 3: This book is helpful, but I do wish it had more information on the comparison between publishing in the LDS market, in the Christian market, and in the National Market. I also wish it had more information on the different genres within the LDS market.It was nice to read. I finished it in one weekend because it was very interesting and chuck- full of information. I especially love the ending, in which the contributing authors discuss what it is like to talk about your writing and your book with family members and members of the church who are all around you (ward and stake members). I like the insights on how to find time to write during the day when a woman is a stay-home mom with kids."
1552093654,"You Eat What You Are: People, Culture and Food Traditions Revised and expanded second edition","Summary 1: Having written a reference work on food myself, I fully realize how difficult it is to research and write such a book as this, and how easy it is to find fault and criticize. And if I had seen the original edition of this book when it was first published, I probably would have found it valuable and interesting. If it had been heavily revised and brought up to date, it still might be. But it isn't. I have been reading the chapter on Iceland and I have to say that it is very misleading. What is being described - and not always correctly - is Iceland in the 1950s and 1960s. A few examples - there are many more in the text:&quot;Some homes have refrigerators with freezers&quot; (yes, about 98% of them) &quot;but most manage with cold closets.&quot; I'm the only person I know who has a cold larder (and a refrigerator and a freezer, too). Refrigerators have been in most homes here since the early 1960s at least. ""Fresh fruits are scarce"". They haven't been scarce for the last 30 years at least. These days you can even get exotic fruits like ramboutan and mangosteen. ""Cattle are mainly used for dairy products, rarely for beef."" Beef is now as common as lamb. &quot;Pigs are all but nonexistent; pork is rare and expensive and said to have a fishy taste ...&quot; Now common, inexpensive by Icelandic standards and quite good. ""Icelanders have a deeply rooted objection to eating birds of any type"" - oh, come on, chicken was not much eaten but not because people didn't like it, rather because it wasn't economical to raise the birds on imported grain. They are very popular now. And wild birds have always been eaten - in some regions they were a large part of the diet. ""... margarine and butter (all unsalted)"". Totally wrong. Both margarine and butter is almost always salted. ""Salt is seldom added (to food)"" Wrong. Salt is added to most savory food and many people salt their food liberally. ""Preferring to talk in separate groups, men and women disperse after the meal, it still being considered &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;forward&quot; if women join in men's conversations."" Possibly in the 1950s; certianly not now.Flatbrau (rye griddle cakes) is never ever served with sugar or preserves, always with butter and meat or cheese. Steiktir partar are not &quot;thin wafer-like pastries filled with sweetened whipped cream&quot; but fairly thick, flat wheatcakes, deep-fried in fat and eaten cold with butter and often meat or cheese, never a sweet topping. I could go on and on - there are so many errors here.Reading this book made me realize once again how much Icelandic cuisine and society has changed during the last 30-40 years and the same is true for most other Western nations. This book is supposedly revised and updated but these updates seem to have been minimal in the chapters I've looked at so far (the only sources cited for Iceland that are published after 1967 are The New York Times 1998 Almanac and the Lonely Planet guide). Unfortunately I feel this is a reference work that I can not trust - it is so inaccurate and out of date.
Summary 2: Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este ser&iacute;a &quot;el libro&quot; para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de M&eacute;xico y ahora vivo en Brasil, lo primero que le&iacute; fue lo referente a estoa paises. QUE DECEPCI&Oacute;N!La idea del libro es excelente y seguramente la autora tuvo que viajar, leer y estudiar mucho, pero pienso que debi&oacute; haber pedido ayuda a que revisaran sus cap&iacute;tulos personas conocedoras de cada pa&iacute;s o regi&oacute;n.Tiene muchos errores hist&oacute;ricos, geogr&aacute;ficos, culinarios y de ortograf&iacute;a del idioma original. Estoy preparando una lista de ellos que posteriormente enviar&eacute;.La felicito por su dedicaci&oacute;n, perodes graciadamente el resultado no es del todo bueno.Hans Rio de Janeiro/Brasil
Summary 3: Reading a very favorable review in New York Times, I bought the book without even opening it at the book store. As I am researching on the cooking of my home state in India, I was hopeful of finding a lot of information in it. But to my great disappointment, several historical facts were incorrect. Thelma Barer-Stein began the historical narrative on India by saying that all foreign conquerers came to Delhi.History reminds us that the Poruguese navigator Vaso da Gama arrived not at Delhi, but at the other end of India, at Calicut, in the state of Kerala. The Romans, Greek, Syrians and the Arabs had invaded the southern part of Inida way before that. About religion she says&quot; Greek thinking in 300 BC and Buddhisam in 200 BC was followed by Hindu beliefs&quot;. First of all Hinduism was there first, and Buddhisam originated India, both before the invation of the Greeks. About food, the statement &quot;fruits and vegetables are eaten in season only sapraingly; more consumed in the form of pickles, condiments and chutneys&quot; is totally wrong, written by someone who has not tasted the varied and rich vegetarian cuisine of India. Then she goes on to write about several fruits, completely ignoring India's favorite fruit the mango. Finally the statement &quot;In Cochin, in Kerala province, foods are very plain, and rice and coffee prevail. Rice, fish and vegetables and seafood make up the diet...&quot; is waht is prompting me to write this review. Probably the author only ate these foods in Cochin; but as a native of Cochin and a life long vegetarian, I can assure you that our vegetarian cuisine is neither very plain not very bland. Our vegetable crop is enriched by the centuries long foreign invasions. There were several other incorrect facts in the chapter. I did not read any other chapters and my comments are strictly about the chapter on India. But I have to say I was very disappointed and returned the book the very next day.I understand the author undertook a herculian effort study the food and culture of the world. This book makes one realize how vast and uncomprehensible the subject is.
Summary 4: Most of the reviewers here are giving it one star because they are upset that the book has a few errors regarding their native cuisine. So what? This book is wonderful. Its very crybaby-ish to get upset about inaccuracies regarding food. There are some errors, but that can only be expected in such a comprehensive volume. I have traveled many places in the world, and the book is absolutely correct about some things regarding the food in those countries. Its also very comprehensive and covers food and dietary habits in countries all over the world, including various regions of the U.S.A. (Eastern seaboard, Hawaii and Alaska, Midwestern, New England, Pacific Northwest, New Orleans, Southern Regions and Southwestern). I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys sampling food from other countries, its also a good reference book for chefs and cooks.
Summary 5: This book is truly a labor of love. No other book has such varied multicultural information all in one place. This book should be celebrated for its diversity and insight into the world of every imaginable cooking experience on the planet.I value this book highly for it's insight into a world I may not be able to visit without a reading tour. I have found her research to mirror much of my own research and I would highly recommend this book to those who look at cooking from an intellectual level and are curious about other cultures.My grandmother has always told me I have a Norwegian heritage and I was delighted by the 7 carefully written pages on this subject.If you want an overview of cooking from Africa, Albania, America, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Holland, England, France, Germany, Iran or even Japan....this is the book for you. While you will not find recipes you will finally understand what Mealie-meal is or why Bobotie is so good.~The Rebecca Review"
B000PIPU4S,Frederick Douglass,"Summary 1: Looking for a biography of the former slave turned lecturer and abolitionist, I came across this work by author McFeely. The first section regarding the birth and circumstances of Douglass' flight to freedom was full of what I consider &quot;psychobabble&quot;. The author makes too many conjectures concerning the relationship of Douglass with his owner, including possible latent homosexual feelings but never includes any information to back this claim up. The story picks up when Douglass moves to New England and becomes involved in the abolistionist causes. His travels to England and his relationship with women working for the cause of women's suffrage is particularly interesting. However, the remainder of the book seems to meander with no purpose.I am still searching for a biography which puts this man's life into context.
Summary 2: Frederick Douglass is an authentic American and a heroic figure. For those wishing to become aquainted with a chronicle of his life, McFeely's book will do the job.Born a slave in Maryland, Douglass accomplished the difficult task of self education in an era when slaves were not taught under penalty of law. &quot;Running away with himself&quot; (as Southerners used to describe slaves who escaped) twenty years before the Civil War, he became one of our country's great orators in telling the tale of his life as a bondsman and urging that America embrace emancipation of all slaves. He was perhaps the anti-slavery movement's best spokesman. Not only for the sheer eloquence with which he captivated audiences, but as living proof that a black could be educated to a level reached by few people of any race.Douglass did his part for the Union in the Civil War and bought into Republicanism as the best political vehicle for achieving the end of slavery and the leveling up of blacks to their rightful place in American society. His hopes were frustrated after the Civil War when his party turned away from Reconstruction and blacks were subjugated anew by racism, indifference and Jim Crowism.Douglass was an idealist in that he believed that America could be exhorted into granting slaves not only their freedom but their civil rights and social equality. His country failed his vision miserably and he ended his life personnally successful (as successful as his skin color could take him in the 1890's) but very distraught at the chasm between his hopes for a free America and the reality.This is an adequate book, though dry at times. It follows Douglass chronologically. In episodes where his life was a fascinating story -- as a slave, his escape, his establishment in the North, as a politician and as US minister to Haiti -- the book is a fascinating tale. Not so fascinating are long accounts of his work on the road delivering speeches as an agent of the anti-slavery movement. Part of the problem with writing a biography of a man who was in large part a professional orator is that the chapters focusing on that work are not very exciting. Mcfeely spends a lot of ink detailing his journies on the stump and his meetings with many characters who were part of the American and English anti-slavery movements. Douglass's life flow, when examined chronologically, produces a story of varying degrees of drama. Although any biograhpher is limited by his character, I had the feeling throughout that Douglass's life could be told with more verve without sacrificing the facts.What McFeely should have jettisoned were several parts where he delved into psychobabble -- speculations about sexual attraction or the depth of feeling between Douglass and several figures in his life. Human feelings and attractions are an important part of any biography and certainly shaped Douglass's life. McFeeley speculates on several without any facts to support his views. These are relegated to the first half of the book and do not intrude greatly, however.If one needs or wants to learn about the life of this great American, McFeeley's book will fill the bill.
Summary 3: I am curious to know the previous reviewer found William McFeely's observations/analysis of Frederick Douglas racist. I too found a lot of overly subjective tones within the work of Mr. McFeely's analysis of Frederick Douglas, but I also found that his analysis captured, for me, Frederick Douglas' strong positive character, and sense of universal humanity. Mr. McFeely's analysis, while in some instances deductive, yet subjective in others, presented a man - not a God, who held fast to is universal convictions, but who was also subject to human frailties. Mr. McFeely's analysis of Douglas has reinforced my admiration in Frederick Douglas even more.
Summary 4: I have just finished reading this book & as a white person didn't find it at all racist but perhaps I am missing some things? McFeely is a Pulitzer Prize wining author (for his bio of Grant) & a professor of literature at the University Of Georgia..It seemed to me meticulously researched & very scholarly. Much is taken from The writings of Douglass. The author is very discreet about Douglass's personal relationships because there is nothing to factually support anything definitive. His first wife & mother of his 5 children was certainly not his intellectual equal & they had nothing in common except for race & their children.After Lincoln's death, Andrew Johnson became president & he was a real southern bigot. Douglass began seeing all the great hopes he had of moving forward being slowly unravelled.I found it very interesting that all the liberal forward moving attitudes came from the North. The North was not without much de facto segregation , but compared to the South, it was a paradise!The states of the Confederacy have rewritten history & have up to the present time been an albatross around our country's neck.Douglass died just as new laws of Jim Crow were being enacted & right before the Supreme Court said separate but equal was legal. How can one understand why these 9 men (at the time) were so warped in their thinking. How could anything be equal when one group is separated legally from another because of race? What about having separate facilities for blue eyed people & brown eyed people.?I was glad he got a post in Haiti as some sort of recognition but it wasn't the best place for a man of his immense talents.I never heard of Ida B Wells until I read this book but she was the author of legislation to stop lynching and , among others, carried the torch for him after he was too old to go on. Very tragic that he could not have lived to see Obama as our wonderful President.Douglass was for universal human rights but many women suffragists (Susan B Anthony for one) felt that granting males universal suffrage wouldn't be acceptable because half the population would still be disenfranchised. When Douglass married his second wife, Helen Pitts, a white woman who was really his companion & helper, Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote them a congratulatory letter but Anthony told her not to make it public for fear of losing the support of southern white women. Was Anthony a racist? I really don't think so but she certainly was politically practical about her MAIN goal of the vote for all women equal to men.Within 20 years, slavery by another name was being enforced in the deep South with Jim Crow laws & chain gangs ""renting out"" convict labor.I would like someone to tell me what they thought racist in this book because I didn't see it.am I just obtuse?
Summary 5: I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash."
B0006C04UI,"Mystery of the witch, who wouldn't","Summary 1: Anyone who's read Kin Platt knows to expect a tight, sometimes humorous, always spine-tingling adventure with a bit of psychological daring-do thrown in for good measure. This time, Steve and Sinbad are out to solve the mystery of all mysteries. By all appearances, all of the &quot;clues&quot; seem to be in Steve's head when, before you know it, Minerva's dad meets the business end of a time bomb, Steve finds an old neighbor under the spell of Mandrake (a bracelet made of a mandragora root), Herk and Steve stumble onto the witch who wouldn't (for her own reasons), and a platinum blonde who looks older than she should, along with a legendary Hollywood vampire, do their best to ensure Steve and Sinbad are out of their hair forever.Sign up for the waiting list, and spend your spare time cloud-busting while you wait for this outstanding book. You'll be glad you did!
Summary 2: This is the sequel to Kin Platt's excellent mystery ""Sinbad and Me"". All the great characters are back: adventurous teenager Steve, his heroic bulldog Sinbad, girlfriend Minerva, her suspicious dad the Sheriff, Herk, all investigating goings on involving witches, mandrake root, and a deadly bracelet. What a great book! If you are ten on up, you'll love it! If you are an old person, you will still love it!
Summary 3: I can't recommend this book enough. I am actually here to order it, and although I haven't read it in over 35 years, I remember it like it was yesterday. My only other comment for now is that I can't believe that this book was never made into a movie. When you read it you will understand. This is a story that both kids and adults will love. Please let me know what you think after reading this book."
B0007HJELC,Four lives in the bebop business,"Summary 1: Spellman, a lucid analyst of the avant garde jazz movement in the '60s (see his liner notes, for example, on the original release of Coltrane's &quot;Ascension&quot;), has contributed with this book four compelling portraits of musicians who gave and have given their lives to jazz.&quot;Four Lives in the Bebop Business&quot; profiles two altoists, Jackie McLean and Ornette Coleman; and two pianists, Cecil Taylor and Herbie Nichols. Spellman skillfully crafts the narratives, while wisely allowing his subjects to tell large chunks of their stories in their own words.It becomes clear as one reads the book that it took a lot of guts to be a jazz musician during the '50s and '60s (and still does). All four of the musicians faced major obstacles in pursuing their art.McLean, who enjoyed the greatest amount of commercial success of the four, especially early on, battled drug addiction. Taylor and Coleman faced open hostility because of their challenging, groundbreaking approaches to playing their instruments. Nichols (the only one of the four who is not still alive) was just plain ignored, despite his brilliantly original playing (check out the two-disk Blue Note compilation of his music), and spent much of his all-too-brief career playing in Greenwich Village dives.In spite of bad accommodations, poor pay, public indifference, critical hostility and difficulty finding gigs, these artists, the book makes clear, would never play anything other than jazz. In this sense, the book has an underlying inspirational message. Still, it remains for America to fully embrace its only true indigenous art form, something which to this day has not occurred.The book also offers insights from the musicians on the creative process and about the historic changes in jazz that occurred during the '60s, from the perspective of men who were on the front lines of the battles between critics, musicians, and the listening public.Required reading for the serious jazz listener.
Summary 2: This book is a great resource for someone looking for words to match the music of such greats as Ornette Coleman. Not only does it look at the lives and developments of these people as musicians, but also at the constant struggles such artists faced (still face?) in the music industry. I can't imagine there was any other book of its kind back when it was first published in 1966, but that aside, its still worth a read now that such important jazz figures are more widely appreciated. Spellman has a deep respect for the musicians he writes about. More than a respect, a reverence. This is particularly true of the section dedicated to Herbie Nichols. I picked this book up simply because I'm a huge Ornette Coleman fan, but I think my favorite parts of the book were the conversations with Cecil Taylor. His perspective on Stockhausen is priceless and pretty entertaining.
Summary 3: I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The four biographies were wonderful and deepened my understanding of the bebop era and what life is like for career musicians. I was at first drawn to this book because of the biography of Herbie Nichols; I own the complete works of Herbie Nichols on CD but until I read this book only knew that he was unappreciated during his lifetime. Now I really understand Mr. Nichols and my respect for him and ability to appreciate his music is much deeper. Same for Ornette Coleman, who until I read his biography here was to my mind merely an eccentric who had helped ruin the commercial viability of jazz. Thanks to this book I now understand how sincere and committed and courageous Ornette Coleman was. I bought this book on Amazon about a month ago and I do not understand why Amazon lists it, a month later, as &quot;out of print&quot;. I urge anyone who wants to deepen his/her understanding of jazz music to read this wonderful book. People who want to learn jazz can no longer simply go to 52nd Street in NYC and learn from the masters directly. Books such as this book, videos, and CD's are the only way for the current and future generations to learn about the golden age of jazz. Thus, this book is *essential* for a sincere student of jazz. The book's high quality is worthy of the heavy responsibility it thus bears. By the way in the course of the four biographies it contains a lot of fascinating detailed insights about Theolonius Monk, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker."
0596500033,Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families,"Summary 1: Anyone whose life is significantly impacted by partial seizures, whether directly or indirectly, should own this book. This is the only book that I have come across that specifically addresses partial seizures (simple and complex), and as such it is tremendously valuable to parents, friends, family members, and people who have Epilpesy themselves. It seems that books on Epilepsy are either very cheap (and broad and shallow in scope) or extremely expensive (and bordering on encyclopedic), but this book falls nicely in the middle. It weighs in at a reasonable price and provides a wealth of information that an interested person might otherwise only find by sifting through a large volume.I have read this book twice and I was still learning as I read it the second time. It includes lots of personal accounts, both by people who have seizures and caregivers (mostly parents of children with seizures). I think that these varied accounts provide a great deal of insight, particularly for those who don't themselves have seizures but must face its issues. The book includes lots of resources in terms of books, addresses, websites, and organizations, and also includes a good section on insurance issues. If your life is affected by partial seizures, you should have this book.
Summary 2: This is THE BEST book to come out for epilepsy in a long time. It is great for both adults or parents of children with epilepsy, covering everything from medications, complimentary medicine, the various types of seizures and possible causes. I found Ms. Waltz's information is very up-to-date (writing this in June 2001). The reference guide at the back of the book is a helpful resource for finding various support resources, including oversea pharmacies. I highly recommend this book to anyone whose life has been touched by seizures.
Summary 3: This book is informative on all aspects of partial seizure disorders, from discovery to diagnosis and treatment. I loved how easy it was to read. I read this book in less than 2 days! My only disappointment is that the book didn't touch a little more on the psychological impact of the disorders (and subsequent consequences).
Summary 4: Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families by Mitzi Waltz is now the second book I've read about seizures since having another seizure last month. This book is an excellent complement to the first book I read on living well with epilepsy.While this book does not have some of the details that the previous book I read has, this book has more information overall which is why I found them to be complementary.The author begins by distinguishing between the different types of seizures, explaining the parts of the brain, and explaining how seizures work. She ends the first chapter by talking about what to do when you have a seizure or when you see someone having a seizure. This information was very enlightening to me because I didn't know that seizures are rarely harmful. If a person is kept away from anything harmful, and people around them, make sure that they do not suffocate on food or anything else in the mouth, unless a seizure goes on for a prolonged period of time, the best thing to do is be with the person and try to help them relax (15-16).In the second chapter, she explains how to diagnose the type of seizure - if it is a seizure - that one has experienced. She incorporates first-hand accounts to flesh out the doctors and procedures that are used. She also discusses things which may look like seizures which are not.The third chapter deals with how to live with having a seizure disorder, and she discusses ADA, discrimination, rates, and limitations that one will have to accept. She discusses how important it is to have support from professionals and family and/or friends.The fourth chapter deals with seizures in children and has a wealth of information about how to deal with the school system and help that is available to children in schools. She not only talks about schools in the United States, but what help is available in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.The fifth chapter deals with medical intervention. She discusses antiepileptic drugs and has a detailed description of the most used ones, their side effects, and tips about them - which is immensely helpful when you're first trying out drugs. Whether it be this book or the PDR or some other drug handbook, it is important for the patient to do his or her own research and be able to discuss with the doctor what different drugs do and do not do. Some doctors will not like to be questioned, but it is the patient's right to understand what's going on and what might happen. The chapter continues looking at blood tests, EKGs, as well as other tests, surgery, and ongoing research.In the six chapter she looks at dietary treatment, environmental triggers, vitamins and supplements, herbs, and general care of the whole person.In the final chapter. She deals with issues of health insurance - and again she looks primarily at the United States but also looks at benefits and Canada, the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. She also looks at alternatives to insurance. These issues become very important, especially when treating chronic condition - and because most health insurance policies have very limited mental health options.The book ends with an appendix of resources - where one can find information about epilepsy, seizures, the ADA, support and advocacy, medical references, drug company assist programs, and on and on. This appendix alone would be worth the price of the book.Second appendix includes an example of a seizure diary which can be helpful in keeping records as one diagnoses and treats seizure disorders.Finally, there is an extensive glossary of terms, which will be very helpful for reading this book, talking to one's doctor, and reading other books on this topic.This is an excellent resource, and I have found it helpful as I am learning about what is going on in my brain and how to cope with it.
Summary 5: .......with basic factual info. A must have if you were recently diagnosed with partial seizures."
B00005X3Z7,Voorloper,"Summary 1: Voorloper (1980) is a standalone SF novel in the Forerunner universe. It is set on Voor, an agricultural world with a history of mysterious deaths. After fifty years of settlement, a hamlet in the north was wiped out by something since called Shadows. A couple of years later, another town was attacked. Then people in other villages disappeared until all northern hamlets were abandoned and everyone moved south.Only a very few survived the malicious incursions. In one town, only a five year old boy remained alive, but without any memories of his past. In another town, a four year old girl, two infants and a brain damaged women survived the mysterious attack. No other survivors were ever found.The Tangle covers a large area of Voor's northern plain. It consists of intertwined vegetation with large thorns and deadly properties. It acts as a natural distort, blanking radio and even vision. Aircraft that fly too low above it are brought down into the greenery and seldom recovered. Even blasters are useless against the vegetation.In this novel, Bart s'Lorn was the only survivor of Mungo Town. His father -- Mac Turley s'Ban -- was away from the hamlet at the time of the attack, but his mother was among the victims. Bart has been traveling as a voorloper every since his father came and recovered him. His earliest memory is of riding a gar with his father striding beside him.Illo is a survivor of the Shadow attack on Voor's Grove. She is even younger than Bart, but is a trained healer. She asks Bart's father for passage to the north and is given permission to accompany them.Mac s'Ban has been scouting the stricken towns in the north for many years. In the first two or three excursions, he wore a Survey exosuit to protect himself from any noxious substances or lifeforms. Later, he rummaged through the ruins in his normal clothes. Yet he never let Bart go with him into the deserted towns.In this story, a great storm strikes while they are far into the grassy plains. They free the gars and barricade themselves within the wagon. But the storm pushes the wagon across the plains and finally down into a gully.Mac is badly hurt in the final crash. Bart and Illo try to lay him out on the floor, but the wagon in tilted forward with loose cargo all over the place. Illo manages to straighten him out on a board and treats his wounds as best she can.Bart climbs out the front of the wagon over the raging stream that now fills the gully and clambers over the wagon to the rear entrance. He then works the large, heavy cargo crate back from the inside door and the two of them carry the board holding Mac up the bank to solid ground. While Illo continues to treat Mac, Bart climbs back down and takes everything whole and movable out of the wagon.Later that night, Mac tells Bart to take his body back to Mungo Town and then dies. Bart encases Mac in the Survey suit and seals it with glue from the cargo. Then he makes a sledge to carry the body on its way to Mungo Town.Eventually, three gar return and Bart hitches the sledge to the head bull. Then they start traveling toward the Tangle. They follow the Tangle north toward their destination.This tale takes Bart and Illo to Mungo town, where Bart leaves his father's body and discovers the bones of the inhabitants. There he becomes determined to solve the mystery of the Shadows. He goes with Illo as she ventures to Voor's Glade to find her own answers.The story is not among the author's major works. It reworks some scenes and episodes from other novels (seeThe Beast Master) and it forces the characters through their actions in a stilted manner. Still, the author has a way of enticing the reader into going back for more. Enjoy!Recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of alien planets, mysterious happenings, and very determined young people.-Arthur W. Jordin
Summary 2: This is one of my very favorite Andre Norton books!!!!!! Have read so many times that I have had to buy several copies!! It is so totally amazing how she was always able to grab your attention and keep it!! If looking for a ""fun"" book, this is not for you. However, it is absorbing and does not make one want to scream ""get on with it already""! Andre Norton always includes details that as one reads along, one goes -- was that mentioned?-- yep, it was!! This book is a ""keeper"" for anyone's collection!
Summary 3: I'm not sure which came first: the rock musical, ""Little Shop of Horrors"" or Andre Norton's Voorloper(1980), but both feature carnivorous alien plants.Voor is a planet with a single continent crossed by a vast plain, where solitary traders called `voorlopers' roam in wagons pulled by three-horned gar. Small Terran settlements lay scattered to the south. People who tried to settle the northern part of the continent died horrible deaths from an unknown menace called the Shadow. Whole villages were slaughtered, with the exception of very young children.Young Bart s'Lorn is one of the children who survived a Shadow attack. His father rescued him from an otherwise dead town, and together they roam the plains, trading between settlements as Bart grows up. Unlike the other voorlopers, Bart's father occasionally ventures into the deserted Northern villages to see if he can uncover the secret of the doom that overtook the settlers.When a psychic healer hitches a ride north with Bart and his father, a great storm overtakes the travellers, and the young voorloper and his female companion must venture into the heart of the alien Shadow in order to fulfill a pledge given to Bart's dying father.""Voorloper"" features Norton's usual cast of likeable, self-reliant young adults, who have to fight for their lives, and the lives of all of Voor's human settlers. Bart and the healer, Illo stumble upon the core of the ancient evil that taints their planet. An underground city built by the Forerunners, the mysterious beings who preceded humans into space, is the setting for an exciting climax. Norton often used the backdrop of a buried Forerunner installation in her science fiction novels, e.g. ""Dark Piper"" (1968) and ""Sargasso of Space"" (1955). However, Voor's Forerunners and their `Little Shop of Horrors' is quite different from this author's usual run of ancient sentient beings.The only disappointment readers may experience is the lack of romance between the two main characters. In other respects, this is one of Norton's top-of-the-line alien world adventure stories.
Summary 4: Little bit of an insider joke from Andre Norton, apparently, is in the title. My Dutch wife informs me that ""Voorloper"" (FOR-lowper) is Dutch, and translates directly to English as ""precursor"" or - wait for it - ""Forerunner"". :-)
Summary 5: A book with a promising premise and a very cool cover (which was why I bought it, I must admit). Unfortunately, the picture on the cover has very little to do with the actual story. The storyline is plodding and uninspired. Character development leaves much to be desired. The conclusion is weak and muddled. The first person perspective does not mesh well with the story. The illustrations are somewhat cheesy, and don't really add anything to the story. I really wanted to like this book, but ultimately I came away very disappointed."
1555604110,Crimson Skies: Aircraft Manual,"Summary 1: The Crimson Skies Aircraft Manual is a must for anyone remotely interested in the Crimson Skies universe. The manual details the history and armaments of each aircraft as well as any weaknesses. The only problem I have with the book is that the diagrams of each aircraft are far too similar. If the planes were really made by competing manufacturers and countries, the designs would reflect that. Other than that, the book is fantastic for casual enjoyment or hardcore gameplay.
Summary 2: It should be noted that this book does not contain any information on the planes found in the video games (Crimson Skies (Jewel Case)andCrimson Skies). I bought it hoping to find schematics/profile views of those planes so that I could build an RC model. Unfortunately, this book is really only useful to fans of the miniatures game or those who are fans of the Crimson Skies universe in general. Still an interesting read, but I was disappointed.
Summary 3: This book nicely rounds out the 'Crimson Skies' series, but an actual fighter pilot should have been consulted -- in my case, my brother in the Marines. None of the aircraft depicted had good situational visibility, like the real-world P-51 Mustang. Worse yet, the large number of models is inconsistent with the series' premise of an America split into several countries, because of the enormous engineering manpower and production capital required for even a single plane. America's vast warplane production of WWII came nowhere near having this many different planes. A multi-countried America certainly could not."
0207150761,Wings Above the Diamantina,"Summary 1: This is but yet another Grand Slam for Arthur Upfield. His numerous Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte mysteries are each a joy to the mystery reader, especially for those who particularly savor the works of Christie, Tey, Sayers, Rinehart, and Ellery Queen.Here the half-caste inspector (he's half Aborigine, half Caucasian) is called in to investigate a small (and stolen) plane that has landed in the Australian Outback with one passenger, a young lady who was apparently comatose when it landed! But the plot thickens as this gal's condition continues to deteriorate and ""Bony"" (as all his friends call him) is working against time to save her life.A drunken physician, a suspicious foreman, two indigenous farm hands, and many other colorful characters serve to heighten the reader's delight in this suspenseful tale. And it's not a spoiler to all Upfield fans to know in advance that Bony always solves his cases.This entry is at least as good asMurder Down Under. Highly recommended!
Summary 2: First published in 1936, Wings above the Diamantina is a feast of daring skullduggery, bizarre Outback weather and exotic Aboriginal folkways.Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (Bony) is sent out to the Coolibah homestead to investigate an astonishing occurrence. A little red monoplane, stolen from the flying circus, was found in a dry lake with a young woman strapped inside. She appears to be asleep but, in fact, a strange paralysis has gripped her. Only a subtle gleam in her eyes reveals that her mind is still functioning.It soon becomes clear that the aeroplane was meant to go up in flames, and the young lady with it. Her survival is a kind of aerodynamic miracle, and as long as she lives, she's in grave danger.Bony is the best detective in Australia, a half-caste with talents drawn from both the white race and the Aboriginal. But he'll also draw on the talents of others to overcome the obstacles in this case. The young woman's identity is a mystery, as is her condition. There are no tracks by the plane. And he'll have to subdue the racial prejudices of everyone around him to get the cooperation he needs.At every turn, freakish weather slows down the investigation, but floods, storms and sand clouds are thrillingly described. Upfield rewards the reader not just with a perplexing mystery, but also with amazing verbal snapshots of the weird weather and cruelly beautiful landscapes of the Outback.There's a fascinating cast of characters, including quirky lawmen, a drunken flying doctor, giant pet lizards, a resourceful villain, a loveable old Aborigine chief, and a dauntless pair of Aborigine trackers.Upfield's work is an endangered species, fast going out of print. Won't some enlightened publisher please, please reprint all the fabulous Bony mysteries? In absence of that, I'd advise vintage mystery lovers to grab up all the Upfield novels they can find. This is a great one.
Summary 3: Before Tony Hillerman's justly popular Native American police officers, we had Arthur W. Upfield's (1888-1964) ""Bony"", the ""half-caste"" genius of the Australian police force. Never has he failed successfully to wrap up a case, almost always he has earned the respect of the ""white"" Australians, other than the criminals, who have been involved. These books are all well-written, with interesting backgrounds, and adequate plots within which Bony"" can strut his stuff. It is a series dated in no respect, except, perhaps, in the attitudes displayed by some of his antagonists and, even, law-abiding citizens of the day. I can commend the whole series to any reader, of mysteries or other genres of light fiction, for its characters and ambiance.This is a 1936 entry in the series, requiring our master detective not only to find the thieves of an airplane but also the perpetrators of some type of assault upon an innocent young woman found paralyzed in the plane. It is possible that the average reader may unravel the puzzle of what ails the woman as her physicians cannot, but it makes no difference to one's involvement with the story and its characters. As usual, the nature of life in parts of Australia more than 70 years ago shares the spotlight with the featured and supporting players and the plot. i think you will enjoy it.
Summary 4: If you like detective novels you should enjoy this one. It is well written. Set in the Australian outback, the detective, Napoleon Bonaparte, is half white, half aborigine and makes full use of his native skills. He informs the reader of the progress he is making in solving the mystery as he discovers the clues, while still maintaining the suspense. This is an interesting and complex mystery."
B0007H4QFQ,The Hammond-Harwood House cook book,"Summary 1: If you lived in Maryland, but now live someplace else and sometimes pine for good old fashioned Maryland cooking, this is the book for you. The recipes run from ""Mock Turtle"" soup (made with a calf's head) to ""Green Tomato Soy"" sauce. But what you probably are looking for is seafood recipes. Of course there are crabcake recipes as well as baked rock fish and fried oysters. But do you have a recipe for ""Oyster Pye""? If not, this is the place to get the recipe.Just so you don't think all Marylanders eat is seafood, there is also many recipes for meat as well as poultry. There are also some awesome dessert recipes, such as strawberry rhubarb pie as well as lemon cookies.If you've missed the taste of Maryland cooking, or maybe you just want to find out about this regional cusine, you should by the book.
Summary 2: I first looked through this cookbook in another lady's kitchen. She had it all earmarked and I could tell she had tried many of the recipes. I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic.
Summary 3: The authors of this book were friends of my mothers' and they gave Mom 2 books, one for her and one for me when I got married.I am 62 now and have used this book more than any other I own. My kids and grandkids continually ask for many of the recipes from this book. Corn bread Elizabeth is one of their favorites as is the pecan pie that is a staple during the holidays. If you love good old fashioned food and love the experience of cooking for your family and friends then you should try this cook book. Because its really old recipes that go back a few centuries there's not a lot of explanation of how to do certain things. You probably should know a little about cooking to use this book. ie: Hot oven. They don't always give you a temperature to cook at. Try it and you'll never go back! The stories that accompany the recipes are one of the best parts. Don't miss it."
B000MBV6O6,Artificial Intelligence,"Summary 1: Winston's book is really terrible. I mean truly repellently, malignantly bad. &quot;Can it really be as bad as all that?&quot; you wonder. Yes!! It's that bad!! For starters, the book is poorly organized. Topics that logically belong together are often several chapters apart. There is no overall structure to the book. It seems like a collection of topics in AI that were hastily assembled without concern for thematic organization or flow. For example, the forward and backward chaining algorithms are presented in a chapter (Ch. 7) on rule-based systems, but are not even mentioned in the chapter (Ch. 13) on logic! Perceptron training is presented AFTER backpropagation! Contrast this with the much better book by Russell and Norvig, which uses the theme of intelligent agents as a continuing motivation throughout, and which groups related topics into logically arranged chapters.The examples in Winston are atrocious. The main example in the backpropagation chapter is some kind of classification network with a bizarre topography. This example is so trivial and weird that it totally fails to illustrate the strengths of backpropagation. The explanations of generalization and overfitting in backprop training are awful.The only chapter of this book that is not an unmitigated pedagogical disaster is the chapter on genetic algorithms, although better introductions exist (e.g. Melanie Mitchell).A further annoyance is the placement of all the exercises at the end of the book instead of the end of the chapters to which they correspond.Avoid this book. It is truly horrible, and vastly superior books on AI are readily available at comparable prices.
Summary 2: My business used this book to help us rethink our analysis of credit and prepaid card fraud. While the material itself has been around for some time, it helped us develop new methods of detecting potential fraud.
Summary 3: It's too bad that MIT OCW doesn't have a series of video lectures to accompany this textbook. But then again, if the textbook is good enough, it won't need lectures.
Summary 4: In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
0689850263,Chicka Chicka ABC Magnet Book,"Summary 1: We had read the original book before, this one is half that story, but it is long enough for a little one to work through each page with the magnets.My favorite thing about this book is that it teaches the lowercase letters (we had mastered the uppercase ones already), and this was a very useful tool because she loves to work with the magnets!It was easy for her to confuse 'b' and 'q', and 'd' and 'p' as they are from the same mould (but different colors).
Summary 2: We received the paperback edition of the original book as a gift. My 15 month old loves the original book but we needed a replacement as some pages have fallen off from too many baby tugs. The magnet version is great but keep in mind that this version stops when all the letters fall off the coconut tree (did I give the book away?). The magnets look pretty easy to swallow too so carefull with those.
Summary 3: What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead
Summary 4: I really liked the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom story. This one was more for learning with the magnets. It was good, but not as good and catchy as the original.
Summary 5: My 27-month old daughter loves this book. Sometimes she needs help opening the bag containing the letter magnets, but she will sit for quite a while independently trying to match the letters with their pictures in the book. Or we can read the story and work together with the magnets. The page following the story with the alphabet listed is also helpful in getting her to recognize the letters as we sing the song."
B0000CJHNR,The World We Live In,"Summary 1: They truly don't make laymen's science books like this anymore. The art in this book is amazing, and the large size of this book allows the reader to really look closely at the pictures. I especially love the section on historical geology. The fold-out sections of that chapter blow me away every time.Not only is the art in this chapter a pleasure to look at, it is a wonderful supplement to the well-written text that accompanies the pictures. The text provides accurate information as far as I can tell, though some parts may be a bit dated since the book is already half a century old.I love this book and I just can't believe that I found it in a dumpster!I had to buy another on Amazon just because!As a science student educated in both biology and engineering, I find that this book inspires me to continue to pursue greater knowledge about the world because its presentation instills a sense of wonder in the reader, even one as myself who already knows all of the information contained in the book.Get one of these while you can. It's a wonderful book.
Summary 2: I had this book when I was a child and it got lost over the years, I oftenthought about trying to find a copy but until Amazon I had no idea where to look. It's a great book for kids interested in our world and how it formed and the dinasaurs, underwater life etc. The artwork is beautiful, and even though it was written in the 50's most of the info is still accurate, even when they discuss the shrinking polar caps and why(so muchfor global warming) It's written for older kids or even adults. So happy Ifound it.
Summary 3: This book was published in 1955, and it was the first book I ever owned. I remember spending hours looking through the pages and wondering what they all meant (I hadn't learn to read yet) Owning a new copy of the book now is a sentimental rush.
Summary 4: In the 1990s, two series for young readers (although not pitched at quite the same age groups) provided nice resources for learning: ""Eyewitness Books"" and the Time-Life series, ""A Child's First Library of Learning."" The first is a stunning collection. I am not sure that this series is at quite the same level--but it is a very good resource for younger kids any way you look at it.This volume focuses on ""The World We Live In."" The Time-Life works are organized in a Q-A format: a question is posed and then the book provides an answer that is developmentally appropriate for the audience. There are also sidebar comments for parents, to assist in parents and children talking about the various subjects covered.First question (pages 4-5)? ""Why are some countries hot while others are cold?"" The text then answers by discussing different climate zones--from tropical to dry to highland. Following is an obvious succeeding question: ""What are the world's hottest places?"" Did you know that (as of date of publication anyhow) the hottest day on earth had been 136.4 degrees Fahrenheit in Al Azizyah, Libya.Or, ""Why do the Lapps keep herds of reindeer?""(Pages 18-19) Or, ""Why do the people of the Netherlands build so many dikes?"" Or ""Why do people around the world dress differently?"" Or ""What musical instruments do different people play?""As one might guess, an ancillary benefit of this book is introducing kids to diversity in its many forms, coming to learn that people behave very differently in different areas of the world.All in all, a solid entry in the series. This would be received well by younger kids."
0393050726,The Great Divide: The Rocky Mountains in the American Mind,"Summary 1: This book was a bit different than I was expecting based on the title. The Continental Divide hardly figures into things; in fact I think the South Park WY crossing (on the Oregon Trail) is the only pass across The Divide mentioned. And it's not that Ferguson uses The Divide as a sort of metaphor for a divided country, or some such thing. If anything the Rockies as a whole appear here as an attractor, or maybe a canvas upon which various aspects of the country's psyche play out in several ways. I'd put Ferguson generally in the McPhee camp of writing, as this is a mixture of historical reportage and philosophizing about the cultural milieu both past and present; but don't expect as much science/geology as you might get w/McPhee.A lot of the activity in the book takes place in other parts of the country, whether it's the Great Plains or in magazines popular along the eastern seaboard, rather than in the Rockies proper. Much of the book centers on the 19th century, when the Rockies were first being explored and settled -- if that's the word for it -- by Anglos; though men like Pike, Fremont, and Hayden are mentioned, most of the focus is on the trappers and ""mountain men"" rather than the official explorers and surveyors. Instead of very much about the mining days 100+ years ago we get much on the health mecca and dude ranch aspects. And while there are plently of colorful characters, it isn't *that* sort of a book. Only the last two (short) chapters cover the time after World War II.So to me it seemed like a somewhat random walk that I wouldn't have thought to take on my own. If there had been some great new theme(s) or revelation(s) which resulted from Ferguson's rambles I might have liked the book more. But I was left with wondering why he chose to focus on the somewhat unusual or off-beat subjects that he did. Oh well, at least it was something kinda different.
Summary 2: This book nicely reviews how the place of the Rockies in the American imagination has changed over time. Americans originally saw the Rockies as a worthless ""desert"" but later became interested in classical conservation (like Teddy Roosevelt). Recent decades have seen the arrival of hippies, temporary residents, tourists, and dude ranches, among others. The book does not focus on the factual side of these changes - how many hippies were there and where did they go or how long did they stay - but rather on everyone's alleged views of the Rockies. In other words, it is more an ""intellectual"" history than a social, economic or political history, and a pop-intellectual history at that.As is normal for these kinds of books, the evidence is not systematic but anecdotal. Ferguson's synthesis of each period's view of the Rockies is highly personal and it would be easy to construct alternative accounts. His book also does not go into any great depth, though it compensates for this in breadth of coverage. It can't hold a candle to Nash's ""Wilderness and the American Mind,"" but it does cover a slightly different cast of characters and would be a fine companion volume.The main line of the narrative warrants some reflection. Ferguson sees a development over the last century from early tourists who wanted to spend extended time in the Rockies, whether camping or visiting dude ranches, to the modern tourist who wants to drive through the park, take a few pictures, and leave. If you're thinking of buying this book for a vacation in the Rockies, I hope you'll be one of the people who relax and stay a while.All in all, the book was interesting enough, well-written and a quick read. However, it didn't leave a lasting impression and I wouldn't go out of your way to read it. It would make a pleasant companion on a hotel balcony overlooking a mountain, or outside your tent in the backcountry. I gave it three stars as part of a struggle to stop grade inflation at Amazon, but most people would probably give it four.
Summary 3: This is an excellent book: full of history, information, stories, and insights about the Rocky Mountains. I read it during a recent trip to the Rockies. Not only did it increase my excitement about going to and being in the mountains (at one point I read it while sitting next to a lake in Rocky Mountain National Park at 10,000 feet with an afternoon storm coming in), but it made me think about them in ways I had not previously considered. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who cares about this wonderful part of the world."
B00087U6IQ,Tales from silver lands,"Summary 1: I first got this book when I was in the 4th grade. Thats right, the 4th grade. It is an excellent compilation of above average stories. Ancient tales like the &quot;Calabash Man&quot; and &quot;The Tale Of The Gentle Folk.&quot; These stories can be appreciated across the board by all ages. The fantastic wording creates vivid pictures in the mind, and slips a moral in while you're not looking. I struggle to describe my appreciation for this wonderful compilation of tales. It is still my favorite book, since the 4th grade, and I'm in college. So it just goes to prove my point.
Summary 2: Tales from Silver Lands by Charles J. Finger won the John Newbery Award in 1925. I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend.
Summary 3: i enjoy folk/fairytales in general, and this collection is esp. interesting as a comparison to the more well-known european ones (the magic dog is eerily similar to the famous french fairy tale donkeyskin). there are some great images and situations, and although more than a few sort of meander and fizzle out there were enough uniques ones to keep you reading to the end. not the best, but not the worst either.
Summary 4: This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I.
Summary 5: This is a wonderful collection of tales from South America, which won the Newbery Medal 1925. The stories are for all ages and written to intrigue the reader and whisk him or her to a far away land. Brave worriers, fair maidens, rich kings, evil witches, and ferocious giants are all a part of these tales. My only negative comment about this book is that towards the end it became somewhat repetitive. All the characters became somewhat similar and the plots (although diverse) had similar paths. However, this is a great book for children's bedtime stories, and a treat to the adult who reads it to them."
0415970563,"Classic American Popular Song: The Second Half-Century, 1950-2000","Summary 1: Don't expect anything like Alec Wilder's AMERICAN POPULAR SONG, that's the first recommendation I'd make to you. The second is read sparingly, and disregard a lot of the analysis - it's often tedious. Oh, and do be prepared for an affront or two. Naturally we all have our different tastes but might we not worry a little about the book's sensibility when Burt Bacharach's work is dismissed in little under a page, Paul Simon barely rates a mention, and the achievement of Lerner & Loewe is judged to be stylistically ""dead-end""?Perhaps on the brighter side, this book has a sobering, generally right-headed approach to the subject. With a much greater range and a larger sweep than Wilder, the authors seem sure of themselves. But they don't write a twentieth as well, and it's something of a shame because style of expression is probably the greatest pleasure to be had from works like this. Wilder's uncommon elan and his tailored offhandedness make many pages in his great work sparkle. One could never say the same about this book, I'm afraid. The prose is wooden and the diction, especially the adjectival range, too restricted. I hope never to read ""blithe"" as a description for a song again.
Summary 2: The book which is a kind of a sequel to an epochmaking book by Alec Wilder is simply indispensable to anyone who is interested in the field. It is both intelligent and entertaining, as a book on popular music should be. Highly recommended.
Summary 3: Classic American Popular Song: The Second Half-century, 1950-2000 is a college-level survey of what happened to American popular music post 1950: it continues the story of classic songwriters from Porter and Rodgers to Johnny Mercer and Fred Kander, exploring the ongoing (and sometimes surprising) popularity of their works over the decades and considering both the quality of pop song after 1950 and the efforts of writers who worked in an established yet fading musical style. From traditions maintained in popular song to the evolution of American song styles, colleges will find this a fine addition."
0486279812,Cut and Make Japanese Masks (Cut-Out Masks),"Summary 1: Very realistic and real size paper masks of Japan. Most of masks are from traditional Noh plays. I'm taking a class of folklore in Miyazaki Municipal Collage, and the lecturer Ms. Fusako Izumi, who has been studying masks and puppets for 30 years, told me that it's really nice book with correct details. She wanted to use it as material in college class! Even in Japan, there's no such kind of books to get the concepts of traditional masks easily. It's a pity that one of masks seems to be more Korean rather than Japanese.
Summary 2: You may get the idea from the cover that the masks inside are intricately made from cutting or folding multiple sheets of paper. However, with the exception of the one mask shown on the cover, they are all made from single sheets. Any 3-D effect is achieved almost exclusively through shading on the prints. Apart from that, simple triangular cuts are made in the corners of each mask so they dome slightly rather than lie flat. I found that disappointing. I'd recommend the book for young children, but it definately has nothing to offer to adults or origami enthusiasts. ...
Summary 3: The cover of this book makes the masks look intricate and impressive. On the inside, they look cartoonish. For a Halloween costume, I had more success by blowing up photos of Noh masks on a photocopier and then cutting out the eyes.
Summary 4: Fun book, Brillant and colorful. Should be a fun thing with Children,Large and well presented."
1574883275,Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History,"Summary 1: Historians are still writing about megalomaniacs who attempted to conquer the world by force and subversion in order to impose their ideology on society. HITLER and STALIN come quickly to mind. And while both employed intelligence operations to further their objectives, only the Soviet Union systematically integrated espionage, deception, and terror to advance its worldwide foreign policy and maintain domestic security. Many books have been written describing the operations, the personnel, and the organizations-KGB and GRU-involved. Jerrold and Leona SCHECTER have written one, Special Tasks, the story of KGB officer Pavel SUDOPLATOV. And Jerrold SCHECTER co-authored another with former KGB officer Peter DERIABIN, The Spy Who Saved The World, the story of GRU Colonel Oleg PENKOVSKY. But not until Sacred Secrets has the emphasis shifted to the impact of intelligence operations on the history of two societies-the United States and the Soviet Union.We learn that a KGB agent of influence in the American government shaped American the policy that led to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. And, despite pledges to the contrary, the Soviet Union spied on its American ally throughout WWII using agents recruited from the American Communist Party. Robert OPENHEIMER was one such source as the letter to NKGB Chairman BERIA reproduced in the book, makes clear. Furthermore, as was their way, after the war the Soviets were largely successful in blaming America for not giving them the war time secrets desired outright, so spies wouldn't be necessary-it was America's fault. At first, many Americans either supported this view or denied that any serious espionage had even occurred. The FBI knew them to be wrong-disillusioned defectors had made that clear. But their evidence could not at first be made public. The most valuable revelations-contained in broken KGB codes-would not surface for 50 years. Liberal doubts and right-wing certainty-both wrong-became part of the daily news diet in the 1940s and 50s. But once aroused, using straight forward counter-espionage techniques and the results of government cryptanalysis, the FBI shut down the Soviet networks and ended the era of the ideological spy.Scared Secrets makes clear that despite these losses, Moscow did not end its espionage program after WWII. In fact, it quickly attempted to reestablish its illegal networks and in later years it took advantage of the greed-incentive made attractive by American walk-ins from WALKER to HANSSEN, with many in between. America had its own Cold War successes and the SCHECTERS describe several including a new twist on the acquisition of the KRUSHCHEV secret speech-interesting despite their use of the oxymoron defector-in-place. In the end, America's technological prowess overcame the Soviet espionage and military threat, bankrupting the Soviet Union in the process-America won the Cold War. Sacred Secrets documents well these often ironic contradictions.The SCHECTERS make a persuasive case that, contrary to the moral relativism advocates of the political-left, the United States did not start the Cold War or force the Soviet Union to do so. Would America's post WWII policies have been different had Soviet espionage and subversion in America not been so politically oriented and active? Read Sacred Secrets for the answer.
Summary 2: In the interests of honesty and fairness, I will state at the outset that my evaluation of this book is based solely on the several pages of the book devoted to the Vietnam War, since that is my one and only area of expertise. The information the Schecters' provide in other sections of the book on Soviet operations and agents in the West may be outstanding and exactly on target for all I know, but in light of what is contained in the pages devoted to Vietnam, I fear that is not the case. The entire section on Vietnam consisted of what are clearly anecdotal stories and rumors from Soviet sources. The only sourcing provided in the endnotes for any of the information in these pages is &quot;confidential source,&quot; which is meaningless. The first anecdote in the section, about a Soviet missile officer who shot down three U.S. jets with one missile on 24 July 1965, captured and interrogated the pilots, and personally murdered one of them, is ludicrous. Both Soviet and Vietnamese records (publicly available) state clearly that Soviet missile personnel manned the launch sites that fired that day, which was the first day that surface-to-air missiles were used during the Vietnam War. However, if the Schecters had done even the most rudimentary research, they would have found that only ONE U.S. aircraft was shot down by surface-to-air missiles on 24 July 1965 day (the other two U.S. aircraft lost that day were hit over Laos, hundreds of miles from the surface-to-air missile sites), and that only two (not three) aircrewmen were lost that day. The fact that the Schecters did not even check the U.S. loss records, which are public and available on the internet and in books as well as in government archives, does not say much for their diligence, and it certainly calls into question just how reliable the rest of the information presented in this book really is.
Summary 3: Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History by historians Jerrold and Leona Schecter is an informed and informative examination of the hidden agendas and secrets of the Cold War, and an impressive study of the pervasive influence that Soviet intelligence operations exacted upon American politics, economics, and more, ranging from Pearl Harbor through Star Wars. An intriguing, compelling, articulate analysis, Sacred Secrets is highly recommended reading for students of Soviet and U.S. Cold War political history, international studies, cryptography, and intelligence operations.
Summary 4: Most of the author's findings and re-interpretations of the Venona data (by now well wrung-out), while provocative in the extreme, offers no controversy, as those data are backed up not only by what is presented here but are also solidly confirmed by other independent researchers and sources. Findings such as the Rosenberg's and Harry Dexter White's treachery, even Oppenheimer being at the very least a Soviet agent of influence, are now more or less established facts: convincing conclusions that flow cleanly from what has been uncovered and thus conclusions that any reasonable reader of this book and of the historical record might come to believe in.However, on the other hand, some of the author's findings such as their most provocative claim here, that Soviet Intelligence, working both sides of the fence behind the scenes, drove the U.S. and Japan to war, in my view are utterly unconvincing. And furthermore, seem a bit of a contrivance brought about by a clear ""over-determination"" of, and an ""over-interpretation"" of, if not indeed and over-reading"" of the preponderance of their data and supporting information. It appears (at least to this reader) that these two masters of the spy game themselves, may have fallen victim to having their own tails caught in an explanatory trap of their own making.In this instance, I leaned over backwards to hear them out, to give their interpretation the full benefit of the doubt, yet I could find no daylight between their own rather tortuous version of the spy games (which they themselves participated in), and a simpler one that suggests that due to the mere exigencies of the events of the time, both sides would have made the same decisions without the ""supposed"" influence of Soviet intelligence.These authors seem to have forgotten that there are many alternative interpretations of the same data, all equally convincing to some unspecified audience. And while the difference alluded to above might at first seem like a mere nuance, is it indeed not incumbent upon the authors to first acknowledge this difference, and then to demonstrate that it is more than just a nuance?In my humble opinion, with the carefully orchestrated data presented here, these authors have not done this, but have instead done just the opposite: used the very large areas of overlap in the two possible interpretations (the mere weight of events versus the influence of Soviet intelligence) to further conflate the two and lend unwarranted credence to their own explanation? And while doing this does indeed make for a provocative and a good ""after-the-fact spy story,"" those of us not heavily invested in the spy game and in spy-laden interpretations, can clearly tell the difference between the two.The evidence pointing to the authors' interpretation that Soviet intelligence drove the U.S. and Japan to war, as the sole and only correct explanation, based on the data presented here simply does not hold up under serious scrutiny. A less accusatory way of putting this is to say that perhaps these two masters of the spy game have simply over-determined and then simply over-interpreted their data, data that for very obvious reasons may have been a bit too close to their hearts and their own respective careers.

0710619235,Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook,"Summary 1: This book offers a concise overview of (1) on scene procedures such as triage and decontamination, (2) general characteristics of weapon classes, (3) details of specific agents, and (4) treatments. It also describes precursor chemicals and 4 case histories. It is better written and more detailed than the comparable book &quot;First responder chem-bio handbook&quot;.
Summary 2: Among those involved with the planning and implementation of specialized, multi-casualty incident response, this book is quite useful. Field personnel, command staff, and planners - all will find it helpful. I found it to be concise, packable, and physically handy. About the only thing I'd change would be to laminate the pages for weather resistance.R.D. Lopez, Emergency Medical Services and Disaster Specialist, Dept. of Public Health
Summary 3: Not too much to say; it is the book I needed for class and I got it at a good price on Amazon.
Summary 4: This is a wonderful book for any first responder to have.It is very easy to use because not only does it come with on and off scene procedures, but it also has quick reference tables and charts. On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 10!"
1844570444,The Thin Red Line (BFI Film Classics),"Summary 1: This film is difficult to categorize and even harder to discuss in simple terms. Author Chion devotes a lot of space in this book to comparing each of Malick's three films to one another. Hard to tell if Chion is very insightful or just grabbing for straws sometimes.Of note, Chion wrote this text in French and only later was it translated into English. It is significant because the same translation issue comes into play watching the film with French subtitles. Some of the characters' inner-monologues in the film have words and expressions that just aren't directly translatable into other languages. Chion, being bilingual, has the interesting perspective of experiencing the film in both languages and can make comparisons between the two, noting subtle and not-so-subtle differences in interpretations.I believe that to get the most out of this book one should have seen the film multiple times. But if you are thinking of buying this book, chances are you have already seen the film mulitple times anyway.And for good reason.Recommended book, though a large percentage of seems to be more about Malick's body of work than this particular film.
Summary 2: Terrence Malick's, 'The Thin Red Line' is one of my favorite films so I was excited to read Mr. Michel Chion's discussion of the film. I was pleasantly surprised to see Mr. Chion discuss elements of 'Thin Red Line' in relation to Malick's previous two films, 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven' as there are themes present in all three films. I also thought the author did a good job in discussing the distance between characters (whether it be in relation to the dialogue, or the way Mr. Malick chose to frame his shots) as well as man's distance between ourselves and nature.My biggest problem with Mr. Chion's book has to do with the voice-overs (or monologues) that populate 'The Thin Red Line'. The monologues in the film are incredibly important, which Mr. Chion admits, indeed, he spends much of the book relating the monologues to what is, or is not, happening on-screen. He also attempts to penetrate the meaning of these statements as they relate to the 'bigger picture' (love, death, life etc.) However, Mr. Chion's problem is that he does not credit the monologue with the actual character who is speaking it.I'm not sure if the mix-up is due to Mr. Chion being French and that perhaps he saw a dubbed version of the film, or was just unable to tell the accents apart, but the North American DVD release of the film, does tell the viewer (if the subtitles are turned on) who is speaking the monologues. As well, if you listen carefully, you can hear the subtle differences in voice between the characters of Private Witt (Jim Caviezal) and the speaker of the majority of the monologues, Private Edward Train (John Dee Smith).Many of you may think, 'so what?' Does it matter who spoke the monologue/voice-over or does it matter what the monologue says? I agree, WHAT is said, is more important then WHO said it, generally. But Mr. Chion's discussion, indeed his thesis, is severely hampered by his mistake as to the monologues.For example, Mr. Chion spends a great deal of time breaking down the ending of the film, and the final voice-over found at the conclusion (the one that contains the phrase 'look out at the things you made, all things shining.') He states that a disembodied Pvt. Witt makes the statement (an honest mistake perhaps, as both Witt and Train have deep southern accents) when in fact it is Train that makes the speech. Chion believes that Witt is the central character in the film and that we are, perhaps, trying to understand the relation between war and nature, through him. Dead at the end of the film, Witt can reflect back on what has happened.The problem is that Train (the young soldier at the end who says something to the effect of, 'I've been through the think and thin of it...') makes the 'big' statement, changing the meaning of Witt (as Chion sees him) and introducing another character into the discussion (Pvt. Train). Again, because Chion spends so much time on Witt and the monologues, their importance is front and centre. But because he cannot tell the speakers apart, his view as to the meaning of the film is hampered (and dare I say, incorrect).I value the attempt of Mr. Chion in this book, and in general, the other books in the BFI Modern Classics series, but the fundamental failure of the author to attribute the monologues to their owners, cripples this book's power.J. Adams
Summary 3: Precious few books have been written about reclusive filmmaker Terrence Malick and his films. So little factual information is known about the man, so when a new book is published, there is a certain amount of anticipation by fans of his work. Michel Chion has written a book under the BFI Modern Classics banner that attempts to decipher many of the mysteries and enigmas that surround Malick's 1998 film, The Thin Red Line.Chion recognizes that the film has no beginning or ending and therefore an analysis of the movie can begin at any point, which is exactly what he does as he makes an excellent observation about the jaded character of First Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn): ""But perhaps Welsh has rediscovered that spark of consciousness and anxiety that had been extinguished within him. Perhaps the death of an individual is what allows the flame to move from one to another.""He argues that Malick's film places animals, the environment and human beings on the same scale -- a very unique concept as most movies put an emphasis on one group over another. Chion illustrates the unusual approach that The Thin Red Line takes on its subject matter. Characters pontificate about life and death and love and hate in ""erratic, fragmented interior monologues"" that embody ""mysterious relationships created by the way shots are cut together, in the contrast between small details and big events.""There are several themes that run throughout Malick's movies and Chion does a good job of identifying what they are and then analyzing them. For example, he writes about the isolation that the protagonists in his movies experience. Many characters in The Thin Red Line are either shown to be alone in a shot or through voiceover narration. Direct conflict between characters is also avoided. Even the big showdown between Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) and Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) is done over the phone. Both Private Witt (Cavaziel) and Welsh are solitary figures alone with their thoughts -- Witt with his notion of another world, a paradise waiting for him, and Welsh with his cynical view that the war is only about property and nothing else.Chion's book is an excellent primer for Malick's challenging movie. Newcomers to his cinema are given a thumbnail sketch of the filmmaker and his body of work and major themes. Chion does not just analyze The Thin Red Line; he also identifies its structure and breaks it down into five separate sections. At one point in the book, he even deciphers what the Japanese soldiers say. His writing style is clear and concise and acts as the perfect companion piece to this important movie."
B0008D0FAY,"Tabernacle shadows of the ""better sacrifices"": A helping hand for the royal priesthood","Summary 1: It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses.
Summary 2: For most Christians, the Tabernacle contains a multitude of largely disconnected pictures of Jesus alone. This book shows, based on the Apostle Pauls exposition, that it shows not only the sacrifice of Jesus, but the place of the Christian also, and how we have privileges and responsibilities, too. It is fascinating to look at all the details and what they illustrate.
Summary 3: What an incredible book. Never had I looked at what I thought was the most boring part of the Bible, and now see it was a type for the Church today. A short book, but one that will never be forgotten.
Summary 4: This is an excellent Bible study aid on the Tabernacle, I have read many books explaining the subject, but found the author's findings and exposition on this subject very enlightning, I highly recommend it to all students of the Word, especially those who wish to gain better insight on the tabernacle and its types and shadows and what it means to Christians today.
Summary 5: [...]I would not recommend this book. Russell does make some remarkable findings, however, his theology is corrupt and he is a party to a cult."
0873586808,Jack and the Giant: A Story Full of Beans,"Summary 1: Jim Harris's ""Jack and the Giant: A Story Full of Beans"" is a fresh and unusual twist on the classic ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" fairytale. The twist here is that the story is a western, complete with adobe castle, people spouting slang like ""hornswoggled!"" and a character named Annie Okey-Dokey.Harris has succeeded masterfully in making the story new and approachable for even young readers for whom the classic tale might be a little bit too bloody. The illustrations are an absolute hoot--colorful, detailed, and abrim with delightful asides where tiny mice, rabbits, buffalo and other animals wink and grin at each other with quips appearing in cartoon-like balloons. It's all visually reminiscent of the very best of master illustrator Wallace Tripp.This really is a lot of fun for adults and kids alike, and rewards repeated reading with all the fun visual stuff you'll continue to notice.
Summary 2: Author/illustrator, Jim Harris, has created an in-your-face western retelling of the classic fairytale, Jack and the Beanstalk that will have you and your children laughing out loud. Wild Bill Hiccup is the western version of the giant and a magic lasso that turns french fries into gold, a banjo that plays music on its own and a furry buffalo that leaves golden buffalo chips replaces the classic story's standards. Jim Harris' illustrations are hysterically one of a kind and keep you begging for more. Luckily for us, he is a prolific author/illustrator and he continues to recreate these delightful classics.
Summary 3: This atypical version of the well known fairy tale is a delight to both young and old alike. The creative storytelling carries the reader along like a tumbleweed in the wind, not knowing what twists and turns will happen next. Jack is the hero trying to save the day and the Bar None Ranch, along with his sidekick the yellow tabby cat. The clever adaptation of this old tale is refreshing and downright funny. I found myself laughing at the antics of the tabby throughout the story. My favorite character is the one who gives the giant the gold in a very original way (I won't give it away, you'll have to read it for yourself!) 'Jack and the Giant' captures the spirit of the west in its delightful illustrations. Each page holds a reader's attention while they try to take in all the action in the pictures. Jim Harris is a tremendously talented illustrator who seems to bring to life each of his characters with the ink of his pen. He truely has a gift to share with children of all ages! Anyone who loves fairy tales will enjoy 'Jack and the Giant' by Jim Harris.
Summary 4: This wonderful book has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!"
0135980380,Corrections in America: An Introduction,"Summary 1: I am using this textbook in a class and it is a whopper. Wonderful pictures, easy to read, clear colors and understandable. I've been working in prisons for 5 years and this book makes a lot of sense. You ought to read their sections on women in prison and on probation. I loved the parts on geriatric prisoners (old cons) and the death penalty. And it is easy to read. More!
Summary 2: I purchased this book, obviously, for a class,and I thought it was actually interesting. I had many texts that literally put me to sleep, but this one is different. It makes you think about the penal system in this country, and introduces issues to make you think about things other than locking up the bad guys and throwing away the key. My husband even wanted to read it when I finished my class!!! Recommend highly!!!!
Summary 3: Wow! What a great and interesting textbook. I think this is the first time I've actually been &quot;current&quot; in the reading required for a college course. I'd like to add that the study guide that you can purchase to accompany this textbook is excellent as well. I'd recommend a course that uses this book to anyone with an interest in criminal justice or corrections."

1590030303,Sacred Beat: From the Heart of the Drum Circle,"Summary 1: Amazing book!!! It has some of everything that I was looking for: the first part talks to the history, myths and spiritual aspects of drumming. It looks at all sorts of cultures too - Egyptian, Chinese, Native American, African, and others. It's a great overview that gave me ideas of areas where I might want to learn more. Wonderful poems and quotes are sprinkled throughout the book as well. Following this there's a practical section that helps you select a drum that's right for you and there's info on how to care for your drum. My drum had lost some of its tightness during the humid time of the year but there's a paragraph that addresses that specifically so I knew it was normal. The next section talks about drum circles and the different points in the circle. Really neat. It's my first introduction to drum circles. Lots of great lore and history throughout this book.
Summary 2: Sacred Beat illustrates the reasons we are emotionally drawn to the drum.Opening with a bit of an ethnographic look at the cultures that have long held drumming in high regard.There's a strong lean to New Age and Pagan uses of the drum today, and the book is light on technique, so plan on wanting more as you finish this book. But all in all, that is not a bad thing.I would not have this as an only text on drumming for spirituality, but it deserves a space on the shelf.
Summary 3: You ever wanted to know why drums are so important in a pagan circles?. You ever wonder why pagans use drums to reach to the God/Goddess?. Ms. Telesco's book &quot;Sacred Beat&quot; has really filled in the gap of the &quot;why?&quot;..the beat is important to many pagans. A lot of great info and history. A must read for all wiccan/pagans alike, and one of Ms. Telesco's better books on the market today. Well worth the money and time!"
0974576700,Play Buddies,"Summary 1: I'm a big fan of Vickery's ever since I read his previous book, Cocksure. I have to say that as good as Cocksure was, Play Buddies is even better! Not only are his stories hot, Vickery writes with real humanity, making his characters come across as real and three dimensional, out on the prowl, looking for sex wherever they can find it. As far as erotic writing goes, Vickery is a master!
Summary 2: Vickery is certainly the best multi-dimensional male erotic fiction writer today. He is the Anne Rice of [homosexual] male porn.But even more, the humanity and spirituality of his characters [comes] through clearly - their pain, their joy, their search, their honesty, the lies, the hopes, the hot , out-of-control passion - everything else human. I was moved to tears, and compassion, and much, much more. Hot, hot, hot.
Summary 3: The towering strength of Bob Vickery is that he is at the event horizon of taking homoerotic literature-and this is literature-into main stream fiction. One cannot read ""Calcutta"" or ""Elephant Men"" without sensing how deeply Mr. Vickery cares about the characters who populate them. Is it sexy, whoo boy, but made more so by the humanity of the people. From Enid, Oklahoma to the inevitable San Francisco he finds his people and gives them to us as the sexual, lusting beings that they are. But he never forgets that they, like us, are humans. They are burnished with an affectionate wink at the reader that says, ""now wouldn't you like to be doing this too?"" I certainly would. Darned if I don't take up following glass installers with red hair.
Summary 4: I'm not gay or male but I do enjoy Bob Vickery. His stories always gets my juices flowing. I will definitely read more from him."
0679404619,"Boiling Point: Democrats, Republicans, and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity","Summary 1: Despite being out of print, this is still one of the most useful books any citizen can read. It shows you where your political interests lie and why, for most of us, the U.S. doesn't feel like the world's richest country any more.
Summary 2: Phillips does a good job of demonstrating why the American middle class was shrinking in the early 1990's.The situation today(2008) has only been exacerbated by 17 years of more of the same-more and more speculation in financial assets and stocks and less and less industrial and manufacturing production.A combination of securitization and banker financed speculation has resulted in an economy where the major growth sector is "" financial services "".More and more income is diverted into this speculative sinkhole while less and less is invested in long run physical capital formation that will create jobs and businesses where profits are based on production.The current banker dominated approach to income generation is the manipulation of the financial assets of corporate America-profit without production.It is obvious that the fortunes of the American middle class are tied to an economy primarily based on a strong industrial-manufacturing sector that produces real goods for sale .These fortunes are severely impacted negatively if the currently dominate speculative approach continues.The core of Philips analysis is contained on pp.185-190.Phillips does an excellent job in discussing this issue.The impact on the reader,however,could have been much greater if Phillips had explicitly tied his analysis to the analysis originally presented by Adam Smith in 1776 and restated in advanced form by John Maynard Keynes in 1936 in The General Theory of Employment,Interest, and Money .Unfortunately,Phillips appears to be unaware that Adam Smith had already warned against allowing speculators to take control of an economy by allowing them access to bank loans with which to leverage their debt positions.Smith's conclusion is that savings loaned out to speculators is savings that is "" ... wasted and destroyed "".There has never been a more clearcut warning about the dangers of speculation. (See Adam Smith,1776,Modern Library(Cannan)edition of The Wealth of Nations,pp.339-340).I have deducted one star due to this omission.
Summary 3: Phillips is an extraordinary writer. He is also non partisan. His analysis is spot on and very compelling. I would recommend him to anyone."
1570670560,Legends of the Iroquois (Myths and Legends),"Summary 1: My kid found this very helpful for a school project. Another student in her class had the book and she wanted her own corp.
Summary 2: I purchased this book because I was writing a novel about the Native Americans who lived in the Finger Lake region f New York State. The book was helpful as far as gaining some insights into the life styles of these people. I really was not reading this book for its entertainment value.
Summary 3: We have some native roots and my grandmother found this book fascinating. I bought her several Iroquois books from Amazon as a Christmas gift and she loved them all. She keeps calling me to tell me about them.
Summary 4: Tehnetoren's `Legends of the Iroquois was devised to instruct Indian school children, and collects some favorite tales for curriculum purposes. Some of the character names clearly denote important historical encounters and events. When I went exploring the idea of the `stone' giants, I found information about American giants and armor skin that repelled stone tipped weapons. There's far more behind that story than what is available to the casual observer.The assortment of symbols from Indian story telling found in this book seems to draw from various Eastern and Mid-western pictures/pictoglyphs and forms a unit on telling a story as a `visual learner`. I bought my copy from a market-place text book vender, and the student notes in the margin were puzzling around the story of two brothers who go out to hunt, and wind up inside the earth confronting a gigantic ferocious beast (a giant mouse.)Who hasn't heard:""the world will build a path to your door, if you build a better mouse trap.""And to the early American, other metaphorically gigantic creatures (because they did and do defy eradication) also included flying insects. If you've never watched the family film, `Mouse Hunt', then you've deprived yourself the laughter of being confronted with the absurdity and the irony of just how un-assailable is the mighty midget tyrannosaurus mouse. (O.K. I didn't have the patience to sit through all of it but it was recommended by the neighbor's kids who played it over and over.)Mouse Hunt - DTS"
141373037X,Snake Eyes: An Alex Stone Novel,"Summary 1: Snake Eyes will rock and roll readers through the soul and controversy of Memphis on a twisting ride of adventures and thrills. Alex Stone, multi-talented private eye and main character, is fascinating. I couldn't put it down until the last page was turned. If you are looking for a book with dimension that leaves you breathless, this is one!
Summary 2: Snake Eyes ~ An Alex Stone MysteryJohn Jay RichardsonPublisher: Publish AmericaISBN: 1-4137-3037-XAlex Stone, a private detective finds himself wanted for three murders he didn't commit, within the first few chapters of reading. This action packed thriller is filled with murder, deceptions, and surprises.Mr. Richardson pens an awesome tale of intrigue and suspense. His writing style is advanced and unique. The author shows you the scenes with his words. You feel you are seeing the action instead of just reading it. And there is plenty of action.Mr. Richardson has a talent for character development. His characters are vivid and realistic. The introduction and development of Alex Stone's character is superb. He is portrayed as seemingly simple, yet is actually a very complex individual whom you learn to love while reading Snake Eyes. There are wonderful characters through out the book, villains as well as heroes.In Snake Eyes the action never stops. Surprises never end through out the book, up to and including the very last page.I highly recommend this book to any lover of action packed suspense.I will caution that this is not a book for the academically challenged. The author is apparently well acquainted with the English language and uses vocabulary that is not generally found in novels.Snake Eyes is a splendid novel. We give it our highest rating of five stars.Lola PierceChariot Rider Reviews
Summary 3: Alexander ""Alex"" Hamilton Stone, Memphis P.I., keeps his nine-millimeter, Smith & Wesson, automatic locked and loaded at all times. Good thing since he is wanted for murders he did not commit.Gambling is still illegal in Memphis; however, that may soon change. Tennessee State Senator Milton Barnstable chairs the committee that is determined to let gambling in. (""Resolution 788"")Penelope ""Penny"" Harmon is Alex's secretary. She is also the only one that has Alex seriously thinking about settling down. Alex could tell from the beginning that Penny was upset. Her mother is hospitalized, yet Penny ends showing up at the casino where Alex plays Santa, A.K.A. the homeless waif. Turns out her misery is connected with his.Through it all, Alex has recurring nightmares about Vietnam relating to a small, bomb laden girl. Alex stays sane by drawing upon his knowledge of Tai Chi, compliments of Master Li Yue Pang.***** A modern day Dick Tracy meets Bruce Lee in the form of Alex Stone, P.I. This story has several different forms of bad guys, such as dirty senators, gangster (triad), bad cops, and computer geeks (of the highest order). Why have the generic bad guy when you can have so much more? As an added twist, Lou Diamond Phillips has a brief cameo as well.All-in-all, this is one fast paced and in depth novel that will keep its readers off center, yet unable to stop reading. Excellent! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.
Summary 4: October 29, 2004Alexander Hamilton Stone, a modern-day Bogart type with a sense of humor is a private investigator in the city of Memphis, Tennessee. His reputation, based upon honesty, integrity, and a twenty-five year warranty on your new roof.Penelope Harmon is the superbly beautiful devoted secretary. She constantly gives off the aura that she has had a physical relationship with Hamilton in the past and that some of it still hangs around even though nothing has ever come of their ""friendly"" relationship.Hamilton receives a call from Detective Felton Isaac Bradshaw summoning him to 225 Dexter Avenue. Both men have known each other since grade school. Upon arriving at the requested location, Hamilton finds Bradshaw standing next to a barely discernible corpse.The oddity of this encounter is that Bradshaw allows Hamilton to move the body around, as well as handle evidence without the crime scene techs present. This doesn't register with Hamilton until it is too late. He's struck from behind.When Hamilton comes to, he discovers Bradshaw is dead!The same day: Penny is summoned away by her mother- supposedly her forgotten stepbrother is back in town. Nicholas Sevier, a homicide lieutenant and Felton Bradshaw's partner shows up at his office. Hamilton is arrested for the suspected murder of his friend then released.By the next day the plot thickens when the widow Bradshaw asks Hamilton to investigate her husband's murder, federal agents join the investigation, an intelligent-homeless hacker gives aide, bodies are beginning to pile up, and an APB goes out, making Hamilton again a wanted man!I got such a kick out of this detective novel, so much that I think I was grinning from ear to ear. The other characters in this story are extraordinary, they completely hold your attention and are just as interesting, perhaps even more so, than the 1941 sleuth actors.If you're a mystery connoisseur, you will without doubt enjoy Snake Eyes!Reviewed by Betsie"
B0006XU3MQ,The Cowboy Cookbook,"Summary 1: Verne Carlson was not, strictly speaking, a cowboy. He was a well-known and respected cameraman in Hollywood, and his books on lighting and lenses are collectible masterworks.This book, too is collectible, and should be selling for a lot more than it is. Verne was an Old West buff - his love of food and his interest in the Old West led him to collect various recipes and compile them into a book that is one of the best of its kind.I have personally seen old saddlebums near tears while reading some of the recipes that Verne included in this book: ""Why, that's jest like mah daddy's recipe!""I can't recommend this book enough, if you love campfire cooking, or even the semblance of cowboy cuisine (isn't *that* a malaprop?).Buy it now for a song, and enjoy it for a long time... you'll be carrying on a great tradition - and eating well!
Summary 2: I tried some of the recipes in the book and they were great. My family really liked them. I will put this in my camper and use it on summer days.
Summary 3: This book has some OLD Skool mountain man type recipes....1 lb of brain, 1 lb. of heart, some red pepper....I'm giving this book put as gifts to my outdoorsy type friends and family"
0805055959,Boys Themselves: A Return to Single-Sex Education,"Summary 1: Boys Themselves: A Return to Single-Sex Education by Michael RuhlmanThis book was written by Mr. Ruhlman before he gained fame with his &quot;The Making of a Chef&quot; and &quot;The Soul of a Chef&quot; combo; it was his first effort at reporting and writing a full length book. The method Ruhlman uses here is similar to the two later efforts; he spends the same amount of time as his subjects at their craft. In this case, that means he is present at University School, a boys only school in the Cleveland , OH area, from just prior to first class, day one, through graduation and a faculty party afterwards.The difference in his approach in this effort is the lack of infiltration. Mr. Ruhlman is not posing as a student, or a faculty member; he has the Headmaster Richard Hawley's permission to wander as he wish, taking notes, asking questions, observing. This is completely different than the efforts Ruhlman takes to retain his anonymity from his subjects in &quot;The Making of a Chef,&quot; and the first section of &quot;The Soul of a Chef.&quot; One cannot help but wonder if a layer of two of self-consciousness wouldn't have been removed from some of the students and/or faculty members throughout if they were unaware of his intentions.Another similarity is the writing itself; Ruhlman does a great job of taking real people and developing them as fully three dimensional characters throughout his books. We see development in students, faculty, and the headmaster as well as observations by the author himself which show his developing ideas regarding his topic. Through his eyes, Ruhlman makes these people become ones that you care about; you want to know what has happened to them since graduation day in the same sort of detail that he has given you with this school year.In situations where there are large issues at the school, the problems are shown by every conceivable angle; student, faculty, parents, headmaster and occasionally his own thoughts. Philosophy and morality take up a great deal of time at the school. Some of the topics, as well as smaller issues amongst individuals, are followed throughout the book as they proceed and develop through the year.The one problem I had was a slight lack of confidence Mr. Ruhlman had in his own writing sporadically throughout the book. He would follow up a well written paragraph with a blunt recap as if he felt he was perhaps too subtle in his descriptions. The full text of the book is reminiscent of this as well as we get 18 chapters of the school year, with wonderful descriptions of the differences between Single Sex and Co-Educational school systems. This is followed up by an explanational 19th chapter that wraps up his opinions on the topic.This problem was a minor one however when compared to the lyrical writing, &quot;character&quot; development and subtle observations spread throughout the book.3.5 Stars.
Summary 2: Ruhlman brings the complexities of prep school to life in a manner in which few writers have accomplished. I both attended and have worked within some of the country's most notable prep schools. After my first year as an Upper School Head, I sat down one day and read the book cover to cover. Ruhlman's protrait of the teachers and students is fascinating. He takes the time to develop characters, especailly the indefteabable head of school, Richard Hawley. Ruhlman goes beyond just reporting what he sees. He engages himself and others in a dialgue that constantly questions the ethos of the school. In one interesting scence, he describes how a senior speech got out of control. Ruhlman gives us the fallout from this display of &quot;entitlement disorder&quot; from all the angles; students, teachers and administrators. Ruhlman also takes the time to venture into the debate over single-sex education. He handles this challenge with grace. However, for me this book was more like an ethnography of a school. Ruhlman provides the reader with a fascinating behind the scences account of a most interesting school. The appeal of this book should be wider than prep school audieance. However, if you are interested in independent school education this is a must read. Bravo to Ruhlman for doing justice to such a complex subject.
Summary 3: In 1993-94, Ruhlman returned to his alma mater, University School in Cleveland, to explore the workings of an all-boys school and study its headmaster, the famously idiosyncratic Rick Hawley. In this context, I'd be hard-pressed to outline all my issues with Ruhlman's project, but his ""fly on the wall"" presentation of teachers and classes is consistently evocative--real, familiar, and true to the private school life I experience as a private school teacher. However, Ruhlman stumbles as he explains. When he tries to make something of his observations--to comment on what's distinctive about boys schools or what Rick Hawley represents or what anything adds-up to--he teeters on rationalization. If, as he says in the book, Ruhlman wanted his readers to ""fulfill"" the ""dramas"" he presented, he should have let them. Better yet, he might have left this task to someone who was not an alum of the school."
1581345992,"The New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs: English Standard Version (Premium Black Bonded Leather, Red Letter Text)","Summary 1: The New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs is exactly what I needed for evening devotions and as a travel book, small enough to be unobtrusive but containing just what I use for my devotions: New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs. The book is excellently bound, the paper is of a very good quality. The only drawback is the small print but the small size and easy portability makes up for this.
Summary 2: If you are looking for a compact, pocket-sized copy of the New Testament, Psalms & Proverbs, this is a good one. The ESV is a respected, accurate translation. This copy is nicely bound and should last awhile with careful use. Of course, given the size, the text is on the small side. But that is the concession in the purchase of a pocket New Testament. Finally, the price is right.
Summary 3: ESB New Testament with Psalms & ProverbsIt was smaller than I had hoped, which necessitated small type. Would like a larger one with attendent larger type."
B000MUGWCS,Old Barns - New Homes: A Showcase Of Architectural Conversions,"Summary 1: Since I own a barn and I want to convert it into a house I've scrutinized every text and every picture in this book for ideas. I expected to be amazed and inspired at what architects and designers have done to the old barns but this book left me confused and disappointed. But if you are looking for a book to occupy your coffee table, at the bottom, then this is the book for you. I felt cheated because it lacked the overall quality and professionalism expected in a design book. It seems like this book was hastily put together with limited resources and wasn't carefully edited. For example several captions of the pictures are misplaced or don't correspond to any picture shown on the facing pages. The books title is, Old Barns-New Homes: A Showcase of Architectural Conversions. So why is there an entire chapter about new construction (Chapter 6)? The only thing they converted was a new metal warehouse into a house. About half of the pictures are worth printing and the rest of them are dark, grainy, reused or just plain confusing. I'd expect old before pictures to be faulty but the after pictures should be clear and sharp. Cropping out a portion of previously used picture, then blowing it up to a bigger grainy picture and the caption tells me to see the details left me feeling cheated. Or even the ""cut and paste"" picture on pg 108 looks cheap, what no photo-stitch? Confused about picture on page 19? Turn the book sideways.
Summary 2: I must confess that I have always harbored a deep love of barns; maybe it simply out of a longing for a simpler time, and all that farms and their barns represent, or maybe because I am a habitual packrat and I'd love to have all that storage! Regardless of the reason, when I saw this book as soon-to-be-released, I got in touch with the publisher and was able to see an advance copy. The photographs took my breath away, and the wide array of barns and geographical regions of the USA that it showcased really drove home that these historic buildings not only need to be preserved, but that in doing so, we can truly enrich our architectural lexicon. It features every kind of barn known to man, from round barns and dairy barns to onion and tobacco barns, all of which have been loving reclaimed and restored into warm and inviting spaces for a new generation. This book should not only graxe your coffee table, it should be read cover to cover by anybody with a love for historic structures and Americana.
Summary 3: I was enchanted with this fascinating book on barn conversions. Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book."
B000JL0JKG,Forms Of Devotion,"Summary 1: It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, &quot;Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)&quot; Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an &quot;easy&quot; book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as &quot;electric&quot;--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten.
Summary 2: Diane Schoemperlen said she found inspiration for this book when her young son asked her how come her books never have any pictures. She then had the brilliant idea to wrap short stories around antique drawings, 100 year old catalogue pictures and illustrations from the original Gray's Anatomy. The results are stories that are compelling on their own but are perfectly enhanced by the pictures put in them. A great gift or coffee table book to be flipped through again and again.
Summary 3: I found out about this author while reading a collection of shorts stories from 1998 with a forward from Garrison Keillor. Her short ""Body Language"" was included and it was the most impacting story of the bunch. This full collection does not disappoint!
Summary 4: I've read more than 1000 books over the years and this remains as one of my favorites. I love this book so much that I sometimes just read it out loud to myself. Seriously, the flow of the words is that good. It saddens me greatly that this book is somewhat difficult to obtain.
Summary 5: I bought this book at a discount outlet on a whim -- years later, I find myself suggesting it for class reading in graduate school. While the stories are playful, inventive, strange, the important thing to note is that the writing is beautiful, simply beautiful. I especially love her story, ""How to Write a Serious Novel About Love,"" which will make you look at a teacup in a completely different way."
1581290039,Exam Master for the USMLE Step 2,"Summary 1: this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly written, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. as an example, drug X effects which part of the electron transport chain? oh my, that's going way back into first year med, which in not what step 2 is about. we all know step 2 is for clinical applications of what we've learned as third year meds, and i can honestly say that this CD does not test these types of things. it was extremely frustrating trying to go thru the CD and &quot;give it a chance&quot; but i just couldn't take it anymore! try the NMS series or the A&amp;L ERT if you want some computer practice, this exam master stuff doesn't cut it.
Summary 2: The software does not cocur to the current USMLE pattern.It is a waste of money. The questions present on the trial CD are misleading....they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!
Summary 3: The most unpractical cd i have ever used.A complete waste of money nothing but absurd questions on anatomy and phsiology in step 2
Summary 4: This CD ROM was frustrating at best with questions poorly written testing obscure material inappropriate for the step 2 level. Just as an example, they asked, Drug X will effect which part of the electron transport chain? My goodness, if that isn't flashback to first year med, I don't know what is. Those kind of questions would be okay, but the fact is, that is not what step 2 is all about. Step 2 is about clinical situations, and this CD ROM is sorely lacking. As I said, it had many strange and random questions with poor answer explainations. It was extremely frustrating. Luckily, I purchased the CD from the official Exam Master Web Site which gives a 30 day money back guarantee. (I don't know what Amazon's return policy is.) So if you really must buy it, and I would recommend that you do NOT, go to the offical web site, at least you could return the darn CDs. By the way, do not believe the EXAM MASTER home page claims which are made by supposed medical students. The claims are highly exaggerated and likely are completely false. Save your money! Try A&amp;L ERT or NMS CD ROMS both of which are available thru amazon. I found the A&amp;L series to be much closer to the true USMLE format.
Summary 5: This was a poorly constructed CD ROM with supposed board-like questions. The content of the questions was not at all like what is on the actual exam. Many of them were detail oriented, but details that are never actually tested and are probably more suited for Step 1. As an example, they asked, which liver enzyme pathway is affected when taking drug X? That is NOT what Step 2 is all about. A majority of the questions were poorly written, and quite random. I tried the CD for two weeks, hoping that it would get better and thinking that maybe it was just me not being well prepared, but let me tell you, it did not improve during those two weeks. I just got very frustrated each time I tried a test. Thank god the official Exam Master website has a 30 day money back guarantee. I returned that baby far before the 30 days were up. By the way, all those medical student testimonies that are on the offical website are totally false. There is no way that the CDs were that good. Save your money. Try NMS test products instead."
0060975113,Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War,"Summary 1: ""To be both primitive and sophisticated is almost always a sign of religious genius."" (a favorite quote from OOTS)When I first read this book in 1993, it expressed wonderfully just about everything I'd ever thought, half-thought, or vaguely suspected about the sacred and the human psyche and their interactions at the most primal levels.The author is a professor of literature, and he approaches the subject more like a poet than a scholar of religion, which no doubt makes for its own set of flaws; but I quite enjoyed the book's refreshingly personal and passionate note.More than merely thought-provoking, the work is beautiful and even thrilling at times -- ruffled by the Divine breath of pneuma, indeed. I recommend it as a unique addition to the library of serious Pagans, pan(en)theists, polytheists, nature mystics, and/or deep ecologists.
Summary 2: To many people Mr. Young's thesis will seem to be outlandish. Yet, he is the one author I know of who actually tries to seek out the origins of religion using modern research into chimpanzee behavior. I wonder what Jane Goodall thinks of it? First there was Freud's Totem and Taboo, a mere root to Young's amazing tree. As he writes, "" . . . the Darwinian-Freudian-Foxian root-stock on to which I would graft the story of alpha-shaman."" I'm not sure exactly how to take him, but it is dazzling stuff. Since there was no impartial observer in the Garden of Eden, perhaps he is correct.
Summary 3: In our time, the rational mind has pushed aside the intuitive mind in seeking to conquer the planet and appropriate its resources to our ends. We become increasingly comfortable as well as increasingly alienated. Our planet is at risk.Young seeks to address the crises of our time by attempting to trace the history of our understanding of and relationship to the sacred starting with what we observe in the apes and stopping at ancient Greece. I'm inclined to label it essentially a work in anthropology.If I've understood him correctly, the crux of the theory is this. To the primitive mind, the fascinating encounter with the transcendent that he calls 'sacred' is essentially violent and dangerous. The two points at which we routinely encounter the sacred are war and sex. He would say that sex is analogous to war. We seek through both an encounter with the divine. When we open ourselves to the divine without proper ritual, it is destructive to society. Marriage and organized religion both sit uneasily with us and serve as valves which admit enough sacredness to assuage our longing, but permit it only within well-defined constraints. Without an effective religion, the male is prone to fulfill his needs outside the legal boundaries and explode into rampant violence. However, in modern times, the effectiveness of religion has been severely compromised by the scientific mind, and the leakage is seen both in the great wars of the 20th Century, as well as in the pleasure we take at ravaging the environment, which we enjoy for the same reasons we enjoy rape.His work is an attempt to understand and address where we're at by tracing how we got here."
0062701584,Your Child: What Every Parent Needs to Know,"Summary 1: The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a &quot;forest&quot; level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight.
Summary 2: Your Child is one of the best books I have ever picked up to read! My toddler and I were experiencing some difficulties at home, which is why I purchased the book. After reading this wonderful map through childhood, I believe we are both going to be just fine. It gives hope to parents that we really are doing a good job at raising our kids in todays world. And if we aren't, it gives great advise on how to seek help. This isn't your typical &quot;self-help&quot; book!
Summary 3: You have a 9 month baby and you wonder which kind of toys to buy him, toys that will help develop his imagination or his skills etc. This book tells you: you should buy stimulating toys. Well, this is not realy very helpful. How about some actual guidelines? How about some suggestions? How about some examples of good toys and bad toys?Contains tens of irrelevant information(with respect to child psychiology) pages like &quot;the safety of your home&quot;, &quot;how to choose your pediatrician&quot;, &quot;baby allergies&quot; etc. Things you read in the other baby-toddler books.400 of pages full of trivialities. No in depth explanation. No real definitions of problems and logic of solution. This is a quick guide to a mindless or indifferent parent. It mentions a huge collection of child problems but gives no real solution to any of them. Just some simple recipes which are desigend for people who don't have much time for their children.Compare it for example with Dr. Ferber's guide to &quot;solving your child's sleep problems&quot;. There you have in every chapter a section to define a characteristic problem. Then several real life examples from his patients each enlightening a differnt aspect or variant of the problem. Then a touch of theory so we parents know what science thinks about all of this. Then the cure and the complete logic behind it. All the while describing what is natural and what is not. Everything in simple clear language. Full of details which you can skip if you like but read if you care.I guess I should have known that this is a shallow book because it covers such a huge length of time from babyhood to preadolescence. But I thought that's why it is 400 pages long..."
089750125X,Kung fu butterfly swords,"Summary 1: plan on reading it but it will take a year with all the books i bought from amazon so i dont know what they expect me to write here lol copy paste
Summary 2: The item arrived in the specified time and was exactly what I wanted. I am very happy with this purchase.

155681478X,Federal Rules of Evidence with Objections,"Summary 1: I originally purchased this book when I became a competition team member for the trial advocacy program at my law school. When I thought about an objection that I could make, or that would be made against my case I turned to this book. I would turn to the objection or issue and there would be the relevant federal rule of evidence easily laid out and explained. Most beneficial is the explanation on not only how to MAKE the objection to the court but then how to properly RESPOND to the objection. This book is helpful as I would know how to properly make the argument to the judge/court. It was also helpful to read over/review the book and look at the objections to get an idea of if you could use something else in your case. At the end of the book it also has the complete federal rules of evidence. I can't say more amazing things about this book, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!
Summary 2: Don't know how anyone gets along without this if they spend time in court. Also, a copy stays on the desk.
Summary 3: This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]
Summary 4: This is a great little pockey sized book. I would recommend it to people either in an evidence or trial ad class, it also is VERY usual for trial competitions!"
0942802047,Fire and Ice: Two Deadly Disasters (Fire at Peshtigo; Shipwreck on Lake Michigan),"Summary 1: In October of 1871, something like 2,500 people were cremated alive in the forest fire that forever changed Wisconsin from the Big Woods to America's Dairyland. Eclipsed by the simultaneous Great Chicago Fire, and because few eyewitnesses actually survived to tell about it, the Peshtigo firestorm never achieved the notoriety it should have and there are not many books about it. This one builds a suspenseful narrative out of the more reliable accounts and anecdotes of the fire, and is studded with unforgettable images -- the self-herding house cats, the pretty girl running down the flaming boardwalk, the farmer who momentarily left his wife and children alone in the wagon ...The shipwreck story is a bonus.
Summary 2: This &quot;two volumes in one&quot; book deals with extreme opposites on the tragedy scene in Wisconsin.&quot;Fire&quot; refers to the Great Peshtigo Fire of Peshtigo, Wisconsin. You may or may not have heard of it. It occurred the same night as the Great Chicago Fire. Obviously, we now know which conflagration received more press. The fact is, more people died, more property was destroyed, and a larger area was burned in the Peshtigo Fire than in Chicago.&quot;Ice&quot; refers to tragedies on the Great Lakes around Wisconsin.If you can get a copy of this book, I urge you to do so. It is well worth reading!
Summary 3: I notice the other reviews of this double book ( two books under one title) concern the FIRE AT PESHTIGO. Just is important is the SHIPWRECK ON LAKE MICHIGAN portion. Essentialy this is one of the better accounts of the sinking of the Carl D. Bradley limestone carrier in Northern Lake Michigan November 18, 1958.Author Davenport picks up the story and moves towards the climax from different angles. One aboard a nearby salty freighter, another on board the soon to be doomed ship and still another in the home port of Rogers City Michigan.As a reader of Great Lakes History this accoount is one of the very best. It may be hard to find a copy as it had been over 25 years since it was in print."
0670010162,The Portable Oscar Wilde: 2,"Summary 1: This edition of Oscar Wilde's work - in addition to its inclusion of much personal correspondence - is a fascinating look at the author and, notably, his personal travails.The novel, of course, and the plays are classics, but I found the letters to be a juicy narrative all their own. The twists and turns of his doomed affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, affectionately called ""Bosie"" in touching - and bitter - love notes from prison, are here to peruse. Reading them, you get a sense of Wilde's personal feelings at the time of his famed trial and arrest for sodomy, his anguish at losing Bosie and going to jail. It's fascinating, juicy stuff - made all the more touching by the fact that it all occurred without shame, in plain view, over 100 years ago.Wilde's a great character, a great author, a good role model for gay life and a hysterical wit. And this book is a must.
Summary 2: Edited by Richard Aldington. Stories include the picture of dorian gray, salome, the importance of being earnest, de profundis, many poems and the selfish giant.
Summary 3: For the reader who has never experienced Oscar Wilde's work before, this collection serves as a fabulous in-depth introduction. Included are Wilde's most well-known works, including ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" Both are absolutely superb pieces of literature. Also included are a fascinating letter written by Wilde while in prison, an essay on art and criticism, poetry, and personal letters and anecdotes. Serious students of Wilde might want to considering reading a more complete collection, but for a casual fan of classic literature, it's hard to beat this selection. Oscar Wilde should definitely be read by anyone who appreciates a sharp wit and profound intellect.
Summary 4: The Penguin/Viking ""Portable"" series make for great intros to many of the world's finest writers, and this edition is no exception. Wilde was a tortured man, living a double life which ultimately led to his imprisonment and bankruptcy in Victorian England. His writings reflect the dichotomy he faced in both is personal life and artistic endeavors during that period.Beginning with a solid life intro, and discussion of the writings by the editors, the collection begins with his essay ""The Critic as Artist"", setting the stage for the follow on plays, prose and poetry that follow.The next work is ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" in its entirety. The novel reads reminds this reader of Dostoyevsky, and examines the duality of a life artificially lived, and the hiddenness of the soul and the effect of sin on the soul and visage of the man. Somewhat biographical to all men, Dorian Gray takes on even more poignancy when read against the backdrop of Wilde's own life.Also contained in the compilation are the plays ""Solome"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", one a tragedy and the other a comedy. Included in the poetry is ""The Ballad of Reading Gaol"", a haunting expose of the prison life and soul rending experience of Wilde while in prison. There are other short stories and a collection of letters as well, including a letter to his lover entitled ""De Profundis"".In all, this is a great intro to Wilde. I had never read any of his works prior to picking up this volume, and am now richer for the experience. A fine author, and a tragic figure - his tribulations come through in his work, and provide the reader with an appreciation of the man and his times.
Summary 5: Oscar Wilde was a master of prose. No student of English literature should ignore him; they might not agree with him on a thousand things (even Wilde felt it was perfectly acceptable for him to disagree with himself) but his wit, his humor, and most importantly his love of beautiful things, must not be tossed aside. Wilde was a genius and a master of the English word."
0533146070,A Fistful of Agates,"Summary 1: This moving, emotional book should be required reading for every parent!It is a collection of letters and essays Wipf wrote to her son, Tommy, during and shortly after his death from a rare genetic disease. It is incredibly powerful. You will cry, you will laugh, you will be touched and changed by this book. In my opinion, Wipf has given us one of the most intimate, touching and honest books ever written.Mostly, of course, her letters are heart-breaking in their joy and love for her son, but the greatest gift is her honesty. At times she is angry. At times her Tommy is... well, a little boy, full of mischief and profoundly annoying. He may be sick with a deadly disease, but he still wants what he wants, right now! Those letters, by themselves, will be profoundly healing for anyone who has lost a loved one and feels guilt or confusion or shame over the range of their emotions, which naturally include anger at times.Having read this marvelous little book, I am changed. The morning air seems fresher, my wife's touch seems warmer and more precious. As the Buddhists say, all things are &quot;impermanent&quot; and we must hold onto the joys and riches of life while we can.Do yourself a favor and get this little book! First, read it. Then, share it with people you love. Give a copy to someone who has lost a loved one to illness or tragedy. Ms Wipf has done something magnificent and those who read her words will be wiser and more joyful for it.I was amazed and a bit disheartened when my local bookstore didn't have it. I was even more surprised when I found I was the first one to review it at Amazon! This book deserves to be on your shelf - for your own growth, and so you'll be able to give to someone who needs it when the time comes. Buy this book!
Summary 2: This is a book I want to give to those I love and hand down to future generations. I love the cover and the story behind the agates which in its own way sets the tone for the entire book. Jane is indeed a most gifted writer, and I thank her for sharing her intimate journey with all of us. Her letters to her young son are her way of dealing with her grief over his terminal illness and his eventual death, but they are so much more. They are a gift to all of us who have ever suffered a loss or who have ever had to hold fast to our faith when we found ourselves on an unfamiliar journey where we had to find our way step by step. Highly Recommended!
Summary 3: Jane is an incredibly gifted writer! Once I started reading her letters to Tommy I could not put the book down! Each letter portrays such unconditional love, honesty and vulnerability, after I finished the book (two days later) I felt as if I had known Wipf's for years. This book allowed me see death from a different perspective and helped me through an unexpected death of a loved one just months after I finished the book. Thanks Jane for opening your heart to all of us!!
Summary 4: The book is a very touching book that deals with a mother's dealing with a child born with a terminal illness, but the book could have used a good edit as many of her entries seemed repetitive. It also would have been helpful to get an idea of the time-line of the entries, Some pictures would have helped the reader identify with the child, Still it is worth the purchase"
067359159X,Drive Right: You Are the Driver,"Summary 1: I have read some of the reviews and it appears to me that the ones who don't like this book are the children who had to read it. First of all this book is not written for each state, so you will have to check on your own state or county laws along with this book. As for this book not helping you pass the &quot;TEST&quot;. Responsible drivers know that their is much much more to driving then passing the &quot;TEST&quot;, which this book goes into great detail letting its readers know. I've been A police officer for almost 9 years and now work at a school and deal with children all the time and a lot of thing seem boring to them. But we as adults must continue the teach, and hope that some of what they read sinks in. When dealing with driving a vehicle, learning by experience a lot of times ends up to late. This book doesn't teach you how to pass the &quot;TEST&quot; it teaches you how to be a better driver, something we all need to be...
Summary 2: I thought this was a fairly good choice, I live in a rural area and some of the things they talked about didn't always seem pertinent to us but, it is always good to read all the material. Overall I would say read this but, always check your state drivers manual if you aren't shure about things.
Summary 3: I feel this book should be required reading for everyone no matter if they are trying to get their license or already have it. Sometimes I find myself flipping through this book just as a refresher. Easy to understand. Very detailed with information that you may not know or may have forgotten over the years. Drive safely."
B00086ZG46,"The poor little rich girl;: A play of fact and fancy, in three acts,","Summary 1: This book started out fairly interesting as being an insight to the impact of too much money on children and the relationship with their parents. Then, it goes into what one reviewer thought might be an opium trip (which I agree with) that went on and on and on, boring after the first couple pages. The end was so predictable, the entire book turned into a major disappointment.
Summary 2: I had this book when I was about 12 or 13 years old and loved it then and reread it, over and over again. I have spent years trying to find it again as an adult then went to Amazon and was thrilled to find it again. Thank you, still love it and is a good read.
Summary 3: I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again."
B0006AONGQ,"Days of our years,","Summary 1: It came just as expected and it seems brand new, I am almost afraid to open it! Collectors edition was right
Summary 2: My grandfather had told me about this book in a conversation we were having but didn't know I was going to buy it for him. He was so excited when he got it in the mail.
Summary 3: ""Days of Our Years"" by Pierre van Paassen, 1940, The Dial Press, hardback, English, 577 pgs. Chapter contents: Youth in Holland (1905); In the backwash of war (moved to Canada 1919); Parisian days; Men and events; The Street of Our Lady; Notes from an African diary; Ethiopian interlude; After seven centuries; L'Infame; World without end; Voices in the storm; Afraid of victory; In the shadow of tomorrow. At the Sorbonne had a curse in Biblical exegesis in late 1920s.. The author recounts the events of post-WWI in Europe; not that he participated much in any decision- or influence-making way, he just sort of reports on various social riots or political movements of the day: people rioted in Paris, Lenin made some remarks about communism, general stuff of no real impact upon the author. He became of newspaper reporter, toured Europe. Lived in Morocco, talked about the fairs of Marrakech and Fez and Meknes - but not really much detail of interest. He reports on several newspaper stories of the mid-1930s detailing how various French commanders had executed various soldiers for failing to follow orders to attack German military units during The Great War (p. 150-161). In this 1940 book he talks about the rise of Adolph Hitler in Germany in the mid 1930s, and recounts how some newspaper writers dismissed Hitler's rise in politics in the late 1920. The author did report on Hitler's demands for the German reoccupation of the Rhineland, but based on information he received from other sources - not his own. He discusses his reading of various books regarding Italy's Duce: Mussolini. He talks of his living in Berlin in mid 1930s, but very general information - one just doesn't get a `feeling' of his experiences. Due to his critical writings against Hitler, he was interned in a Dachau prison for awhile, before being released upon appeals from his journalist friends. The author details WHAT is happening with the rise of Hitler's fascism rule, but not really the WHY of Hitler's thinking. The author is in Lake Chad in 1934, but doesn't really offer much detail about his travels there. He details his watching the French shooting of four Arab youths for some crime [p. 265]. He discusses a run-down Jewish school in the Jewish ghetto (mellah) [p. 267]. In Agades he talks about the slave trade [p. 289]. He visits Ethiopia to detail the Italian's conquest of that country. He visits Palestine to cover the Druse revolt in Syria, and discusses the Jewish development around Tel Aviv, and details his interview with the Muslim `Grand Mufti', who said to the author: ""There will be no peace in this country until they [the Jews] go ... Our people are at the end of their patience. They cannot bear the sight of the Jews any longer"" (p. 365]. The Mufti went on to claim that Jews sought the blood of Arabs. The author discusses the incident when Arabs in Hebron passed out falsified photographs showing the Omar mosque of Jerusalem in ruins, which set off anti-Jew riots [p. 370]. The author claimed that some Arabs did not like his articles in ""The Palestine Post"": ""One day a British tommy...with a blow of his rifle broke the arm of an Arab who rushed me with a long knife as I emerged from (my hotel)"" [p. 387]. In May 1936 he begins reporting on the political troubles of Spain and the beginnings of Franco's military rise. In 1939 he returns to Europe to discuss the gathering war clouds, then travels to England to escape Hitler's invasion of France - then publishes this book."
B000OVAGN6,All Things Are Lights,"Summary 1: This is perhaps my all-time favorite book. It has everything; war, romance, religious intolerance, second chances and redemption. Every time I have lent this book out, I have lost it, because to read it is to fall in love with it...As a historian, I can tell you that the author knows his history; there are no glaring errors the likes of which keep me from reading most historical fiction. As a writer, I can tell you that the author knows how to write. As a die-hard romantic, I can tell you that this books satisfies at levels of my soul that remain untouched by most novels.You can access the book online at http://bobshea.net/all_things_are_lights.html. The author's son as posted the book with a license through Creative Commons. But do yourself a favor and track down a copy. You'll want to own and return to this world again and again...
Summary 2: This book has everything! Romance, intrigue, deceit, Religious persicution, War... with a discription and belief in honor, love and God that parellel my own beliefs. This book has been a multiple read for me and I will probably read it many, Many more times.
Summary 3: I know that it seems ridiculous that everyone who has reviewed this book so far gives it five stars, but I honestly think almost any reader would enjoy this fast-moving book, set in the time of Saint Louis, king of France, about a knight who is drawn into two wars of religion and is torn between two women. The emphasis is on action and romance, but a surprising amount of history is slipped in about the Templars, King Louis IX (one of the characters in the book), the Albigensians, Moslems in Egypt, etc. Kudos to Amazon for making this classic available again as a Kindle.
Summary 4: Historical fiction has romance, intrigue, spies, torture, war and the Knights Templar. Takes place during the Inquistion and France's religious crusade into Egypt. The book revolves around a wandering troubadour/knight and the two women he has loved, both unattainable; and the knight he hates and wants to kill, but cannot because he is close to the King.Very historical detailed book.A very enjoyable book...Don't be thrown off by the title, you'll find out what it means while reading the book.Highly Recommended!!
Summary 5: I re-read this book until, alas, it fell apart. Along with ""The Assyrian"" by Nicholas Guild, it's the finest historical novel I've ever read. In fact, it's one of the finest novels of any kind that I've ever read. I understand it's out of print now but available on Kindle, which I don't own. It could do with a reprint and once again be a best seller. I couldn't put it down...again and again! My only objection was what a fool Diane was--but read it for yourself. No one should go through life without it."
0515093335,Rambo 3,"Summary 1: Very good book! Well written and a def must have for all collectors!!!! It's a little off from the movie but still as exciting as it gets you to want more and more Rambo!!!
Summary 2: I enjoyed all the Rambo series books. I enjoyed how David Morrell captured the essence of the film while changing things up a bit. I'm a huge Rambo fan and always love getting more Rambo!
Summary 3: Co-written by David Morrell (FIRST BLOOD AND RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II). Based on a Screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich.John Rambo. The most dangerous man alive. His country has called him once again -- this time for a mission he will not accept. Living in exile in a Buddist monestary, far from home, he is finished with the glory and the blood of war.Now, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, the only man Rambo trusts, is in trouble. On a mission meant for Rambo, he has been captured by Soviet troops on the Afghan border.For John Rambo it's a call to arms. And an invitation back into Hell...with the help of Afghan rebels.
Summary 4: Well, when David Morrell wrote the novel First Blood and killed Rambo at the end, he probably didn't expect to be writing Rambo III under these circumstances.Sylvester Stallone converts First Blood into a screenplay, lets Rambo live, and writes sequel films.As a result, this novel, based on the Rambo III screenplay in which Morrell is not credited, is pretty quick-and-dirty and fairly uninspired. In fact, in an attempt to add elements, Morrell throws in a handful of unrealistic characters that aren't in the film, when he could have really invested a little time fleshing out the (once surprisingly deep) protagonist he actually created.The whole situation is kind of akin to something like this:Following the success of Misery, Kathy Bates writes a screenplay for a film Misery 2: The Continuing Adventures of Annie Wilkes and, later, Misery 3: Annie Wilkes Judgment Day. Kathy Bates then hands Stephen King her completed script and asks him to turn it into a novel. And thus we have Misery 3 by Stephen King, based on a screenplay by Kathy Bates.As James Caan says in the original film, ""You do realize that this is not the usual manner in which books get written. Some people might actually think of this as an oddball situation."""
1933112093,More Retro Diner: A Second Helping of Roadside Recipes,"Summary 1: A sequel to it's very enjoyable Retro Diner, More Retro Diner revisits those classic establishments of roadside cooking in a nostalgic trip back to the era of breakfast specials, club sandwiches and hot soups. The diner has undergone a renaissance in recent years and while there are no where near the number of diner establishments that there were in the 50's and 60's, people are once again seeing the allure of the tiny, home-cooking stops. The diner influence can be seen today even in many mainstream chain restaurants with menu options reminiscent of diner foods. As the authors of More Retro Diner point out, while all diners sold burgers, soups, etc, it was their unique creations that often out them on the map and kept customers coming back for more.Along with vintage photos and art of diners, and diner menus, the book provides dozens of authentic recipes culled from some of these legendary eateries, many of which are still in business today. Frequent travelers, particularly in the eastern part of the country where diners flourished will certainly recognize many of the names. At it's core diner food is the best comfort food, good tasting and filling. There's the French onion soup from the Oasis Diner, Cincinnati-style Chili, fish & chips, and Ken's real onion rings.Sandwiches were always a diner staple and Mastoris diner in New Jersey boasts a menu of over 80 different sandwich selections. You'll find recipes for classics like chicken clubs, Philly cheese steaks, Sloppy Joes, and the good old meatloaf sandwich. Moving over to the grill there are delectable recipes for chicken-fried steak, skirt steak fajitas, and cheese-stuffed burgers. But getting back to those unique recipes, the section devoted to blue plate specials includes fare like the chicken & rice casserole from Moody's Diner in Maine, in business for over 75 years; the crab cakes from the Blue Comet Lounge, and Betsy's Shepherds pie.For those who long for the feeling of those family vacations in the car of yesteryear, or for anyone who just loves good home-cooking, More Retro Diner satisfies the hunger.Reviewed by Tim Janson
Summary 2: When someone gifted me this book, my first thought was, ""Oh, No, not ANOTHER cookbook!"" Boy was I surprised as I turned from mouth watering page to mouth watering page. I want to make ALL the recipes, and better yet, I can! Not a book full of exotic ingredients and impossible techniques, but real, hearty (and not so unhealthy, as you might think) family meals.Every recipe I make is more fantastic than the next. Thank You Thank You! Randy and Teri are clearly expert in this area, and they have definitely brought a fresh spin to the Retro book series. Kudos to Retro for finding them and getting them on board. Let's see more!
Summary 3: I love these recipes and you can spend a whole afternoon just looking at the pictures and thinking about a by gone era. I just love it and the Retro Diner first book is awesome too!"
B000MUBX7C,Little Dinosaur Stickers (Dover Little Activity Books),"Summary 1: My little boy likes these to put on all his toys to identify his from his sisters. There is a decent quantity in the book and the price is right.
Summary 2: These are nice stickers and a fair quantity for the price, however my kids prefer the activity books which allow them to decorate scenes on the plastic coated booklet with the stickers. These stickers are not meant to be stuck to the book, but can be used to decorate other things or wear on their clothes, etc.
Summary 3: the only thing that I wished the book were bigger and thicker... but in another word the book was great"
B0006E8Q7Y,On painting,"Summary 1: Alberti is one of the more readable of the 'classic' authors on Art, much less prone to gossip than Vasari and less convoluted than Cennini. That said, some of the text on geometry in book one can be a bit difficult to follow. Alberti also loves to name-drop, continually referring to antique painters, but this was expected at the time - the ancients lending authority and historical context. 'On Painting' gives the reader an insight into the tastes and philosophies that inform the arts.Most interesting to me, as a teacher of drawing, were the insights on the fundamentals of life drawing - such as positioning of the head relative to the feet, and the shifting of values becuase of the limitations of white paper (or paint) being the brightest 'light' available to the artist. the saying 'there is nothing new under the sun' comes often to mind - you will read many of Alberti's observations in any contemporary text.Much of this may seem irrelevant to the modern painter - for example, his comments on consistency in portrayal of the figure may have been more relevant in an age when lay figures were used and painting took hours, but nonetheless bring up key points for the thoughtful artist to consider, especially for those interested in traditional painting. Use this book in conjunction with a good pictorial survey of art history (or the internet), so that you can readily refer to the pictures he mentions.For more of my reviews and links on Old Master Drawings, visit http://drawsketch.about.com/od/oldmasterdrawing/
Summary 2: as is apparent from the other Amazon reviews. You would not read a medical treatise, or a treatise on physics written 600 years ago, unless you were interested in the crazy-strange ideas entertained by our scientific forebears, and wondered just how we ever got from there to here--but every one of the reviewers here treats this pioneering treatise on the art of painting as if it were a valid (if occasionally heavy-going) alternative to current writings on picture-making! Just for the record: 1) Before 1436, there was NO known BOOK available explaining how 3-D objects might be projected onto a 2-D surface; of course the geometrical and optics discussions in Alberti are a bit dense: he's doing it for the first time EVER, but what's really fascinating is that in 1436, the science of optics was already on the track leading to modern optics; 2) Before Alberti, NO ONE had used the term ""composition"" to mean ""organic and systematic integration of all the parts of a picture (figures/objects and the spaces between them), such that the viewer is charmed by their harmony, convinced of their truth, and moved by their vividness""--but now we could not do without this term when referring to works of art as virtual ""organisms""; 3) Alberti wasn't even a practicing artist when he wrote this book: he was a young lawyer working in the Pope's chancery, and this book is his educated response to being bowled over by his first encounter with the art of 1400s Florence; and 4) for all its classical allusions (not so rote or beside the point as one of the reviewers suggests) this book is a miracle of conciseness even today, when we've had 600 years to think about what makes Renaissance art so special: Alberti always rewards a careful, as opposed to a distracted, reading (those geometrical explanations are actually pretty clear, if you bother to visualize them), and each of his 3 chapters (or ""books"") is organically linked to the others. Read Martin Kemp's introduction, if you're meeting Alberti for the first time. On Painting is prodigious.
Summary 3: considering that the text was written 600+ years ago is quite interesting when you think about how some of the concepts mentioned now have scientific backing and is accurate to a certain degree but it can be very hard to understand at times especially when alberti talks about perspective problems, but overall an okay book for most part, however not something i would ever read for fun
Summary 4: Book I is a leisurely introduction to the basic geometrical principles of painting. ""I usually give my friends the following rule: the more rays are employed in seeing, the greater the quantity seen will appear. ... Furthermore, the extrinsic rays, which hold on like teeth to the whole of the outline, form an enclosure around the entire surface like a cage. This is why they say that vision takes place by means of a pyramid of rays. ... We must now speak of the median rays. These are the mass of rays which is contained within the pyramid and enclosed by the extrinsic rays ... from their contact with the surface to the vertex of the pyramid they are so tinged with the varied colours and lights they find there, that at whatever point they were interrupted, they would show the same light they had absorbed and the same colour. We know for a fact about these median rays that over a long distance they weaken and loose they sharpness. The reason why this occurs has been discovered: as they pass through the air, these and all other visual rays are laden and imbued with lights and colors; but the air too is also endowed with a certain density, and in consequence the rays get tired and lose a good part of their burden as they penetrate the atmosphere. So it is rightly said that the greater the distance, the more obscure and dimmed the surface appears. ... We call the centric ray the one which alone strikes the quantity in such a way that the adjacent angles on all sides are equal. As for the properties of the centric ray, it is of all the rays undoubtedly the most keen and vigourous. It is also true that a quantity will never appear larger than when the centric ray rests upon it. ... [A]s it is only a single surface of a panel or a wall, on which the painter strives to represent many surfaces contained within a single pyramid, it will be necessary for his visual pyramid to be cut at some point, so that the painter by drawing and colouring can express whatever outlines and colour that intersection represents. Consequently the viewers of a painted surface appear to be looking at a particular intersection of the pyramid. ... Painters prove this when they move away from what they are painting and stand further back, seeking to find by the light of nature the vertex of the pyramid from which they know everything can be more correctly viewed.""Now the principles of perspective and the costruzione legittima. ""Let me tell you what I do when I am painting. ... I decide how large I wish the human figures in the painting to be. I divide the height of this man into three parts. ... With this measure I divide the bottom line ... into as many parts as it will hold. Then I establish a point ... wherever I wish; and as it occupied the place where the centric ray strikes, I shall call this the centric point. The suitable position for this centric point is no higher from the base line than the height of the man ... for in this way both the viewers and the objects in the painting will seem to be on the same plane. Having placed the centric point, I draw lines from it to each of the divisions on the base line. ... [A]s regards the successive [parallels of a tiled floor] I observe the following method. I have a drawing surface [on the canvas margin] on which I describe a single straight line, and this i divide in parts like those into which the base line of the rectangle is divided. Then I place a point above this line, directly over one end of it, at the same height as the centric point ... and from this point I draw lines to each of the divisions of the line. Then I determine the distance I want between the eye of the spectator and the painting, and, having established the position of the intersection at this distance, I effect the intersection with ... a perpendicular. ... This perpendicular will give me, at the places it cuts the other lines, the measure of what the distance should be in each case between the transverse equidistant lines of the pavement. ... A proof of whether they are correctly drawn will be if a single straight line forms the diagonal of connected quadrangles in the pavement. ... When I have carefully done these things, I draw a line across, ... which ... passes through the centric point. This line is for me a limit or boundary, which no quantity exceeds that is not higher than the eye of the spectator ... This is why men depicted standing in the parallel [to the horizon] furthest away are a great deal smaller than those in the nearer ones---a phenomenon which is clearly demonstrated by nature herself, for in churches we see the heads of men walking about, moving at more or less the same height, while the feet of those further away may correspond to the knee-level of those in front.""Book II also has some concrete tricks in it, most notably the veil. ""Circumscription is the process of delineating the external outlines on the painting. ... [T]o do this well, I believe nothing more convenient can be found than the veil ... whose usage I was the first to discover. It is like this: a veil loosely woven of fine thread ... divided up by thicker threads into as many parallel square sections as you like, and stretched on a frame. I set this up between the eye and the object to be represented, so that the visual pyramid passes through the loose weave of the veil.""But most of all Book II discusses aesthetic principles, most of which are amusing but quite trivial, e.g. ""if you painted centaurs in an uproar at dinner, it would be absurd amid this violent commotion for one of them to be lying asleep from drinking wine"", and some of which are more interesting, e.g. ""those painters who use white immoderately and black carelessly, should be strongly condemned. It would be a good thing if white and black were made from those pearls Cleopatra dissolved in vinegar, so that painters would become as mean as possible with them, for their works would then be both more agreeable and nearer the truth.""There is a short Book III with more mundane advice along these lines: ""It so happens that, as rich men are often moved by kindness more than by expert knowledge of art, they will give money to one man who is especially modest and good, and spurn another who is more skilled but perhaps intemperate. For this reason it behoves the artist to be particularly attentive to his morals, especially to good manners and amiability, whereby he may obtain the good-will of others, which is a firm protection against poverty, and money, which is an excellent aid to the perfection of his art."""
0810906147,The Shuberts Present: 100 Years of American Theater,"Summary 1: I purchased this book shortly after its publication and it has fast become a treasured element in my collection.The publication (yes, I know it's a bit pricey) covers all of the theatres currently owned and operated by the Shubert Organization in New York City (and a few across the country).The beautiful, full-colour spreads give details that the average theatre-goer would not be able to see in a visit. History abounds in the richly detailed text that encompasses 100 years of American theatrical history.There are many production photos that add to the story that each individual house holds in its history. Many of these shots are previously unpublished or are quite rare to say the least.I can fully recommend this book to any person who holds a love of the theatre and/or the unique architecture that composes this luxurious world.Note: The Winter Garden Theatre does not have a large spread of, shall we say, post Cats-era photographs (the way it would look today). I wish that the publishers could have waited a few months to get the new shots, it is a beautiful house.All in all, I'm sure many will agree that the 5 star rating I gave the book is well merited. Don't let the price scare you, the endless hours of great reading and history will make the cost seem minimal.
Summary 2: Any theatre buff will think he or she has died and gone to hog heaven. It is virtually impossible to put this gorgeous book down. Put together by the archivists who work for the Shubert Organization, this book covers Broadway with the Shuberts for the past 100 years. Currently the Organization owns 17 Broadway houses. A history of each theatre and what has played there is covered on these pages. The photography and beautiful design make this one of the best coffee table size books I have ever seen. And I have quite a collection. You won't regret your purchase!
Summary 3: As far as I know, no Shubert family members contributed or added to the writing of this book. As a result, I disagree with the title, The SHUBERTS Present: 100 Years of American Theater. It should read: The Shubert Foundation Presents:With a little research the author could have located our small family around the country to interview or get a thumbs up to fly.Also, I don't think the Shubert Foundation ""IS A GOOD THING"", as mentioned in the end of the book. Consider the dark,sinister,devious and backstabbing individuals within the organization, taking over The Shubert Theaters after the very untimely and questionable death of J.J. Shubert.The lawyers that once worked for the Shuberts now represented the ""Foundation"" garanteed the family would never have anything financially to do with the theaters again.Think about it, what family would merrily walk away from Three Quarter's of a Billion dollars...Unless they were scared or frightened?I believe the young Grandchildren of J.J. have a right to know the tragic truth regarding the takeover of their rightful dynasty. Someday soon I will tell them the story of their Grandpa and Great Grandpa and theaters they built. The most spectacular art forums in this country.After the Curtan Closed...Life continues along a much different path."
0030987202,Effective Small Business Management (The Dryden Press series in entrepreneurship),"Summary 1: I attended a small buisness class at my local community college, this book was used as our text-book. I found it to be very informative and easy to read. The section concerning Business Plan development was very helpful. I recomend this book to anyone trying to find their way through the myrad of information available when starting a small business. The book is very down to earth, in every chapter there are at least 2 real world examples or case studies for the student to compare to his or own experience
Summary 2: This book is an excellent teaching tool. I am finding the book very helpful to my college experience. The case studies are very beneficial.
Summary 3: This book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Even after paying for express shipping we saved over $120 from the bookstore cost.Thanks Amazon!
Summary 4: it took a month to get the book in spite of numerous emails and no feedback about the urgency. I finished the summer school without the book.Don't buy anything from this seller."
1551926008,The Healing Time of Hickeys,"Summary 1: This book is about a 16 yr. old girl starting off her senior year of highschool. Haley is a slight hypochondriac, and that brings a lot of humour to the book because in one passage her father tells her that hypochondria is a sickness and to look it up. Refering to the numerous times she searches on Medline. Such as when she tripped over her cat and thought to possibly have Cat Scratch Disease.She writes in her diary (aka her laptop), adressing it as JT junior (junior for short/ protection)nearly everyday about her life. She writes about her friends and their problems, about her father and his ability to have money but no real job, how her mother left her and her search to find her, her obession with JT, and the chicken pox which she got from the boy that gave her the infamous hickeys that just don't seem to disappear.My only disappointment in this book is on the back with the discription. Sure, she contacts a spirit through the Ouija board a few times, but she's not ""that"" into it. Nothing really happens, in fact, it takes up barely in part in the plot. It seemed to just be stuffed in there to take up a line or twenty throught the entire 2nd half of the book.
Summary 2: Haley Andromeda was a typical teenage girl. Except for her dad being a hippie and growing pot in the basement, her having a hopeless crush on JT, one of the cutest guys in school, and being prone to hickey's from a Cutish Stanger. Ok, so she isn't so normal, but this book is definately halarious. I picked it up on one of my book store trips, and I've read it twice since then! Read it, you won't regret it.
Summary 3: Haley Andromeda Harmony is neurotic! She is an extreme hypochondriac and worries about pretty much everything. I thought this book was decently written, but I really disliked Haley's friends, Kiki and Jules. Throughout the entire book, Haley kept complaining about how she couldn't stand them and how they were always making fun of her, and 10 pages later, she was friends with them again. Kiki actually ended up being a decent friend to Haley, but Jules wasn't at all! I just don't understand why a person would be friends with someone who didn't respect them or treat them kindly. However, Haley was an authentic teenage character (albeit an overanxious one). This book was also written in epistolary format, which I've always loved. Cute, fluffy read."
1890460095,Learning Smarter: The New Science of Teaching,"Summary 1: This book is compiled from the online &quot;learningbrain&quot; monthly newsletter, which gives the latest and timely research articles pertinent to education. The book covers a similar format in 10 areas: cognition, environments, achievement and test performance, music/arts, memory, mind/body, nutrition, enrichment, early years, and the fragile brain. Each article gives a succinct summary of the issues based on research data, &quot;Action Steps&quot; and sources. There are just too many interesting and relevant topics. A few examples: &quot;Is Chocolate Good for Learning?&quot;, &quot;The 'Mozart Effect' Under Fire: Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;, &quot;Why Some Learners Strive on Stress?&quot;, &quot;Learning a New Language in Early Childhood Requires Less Brain Effort&quot;, &quot;Neuroplasticity: How Do We Change Our Brain?', &quot;The Biology of Cheating&quot;... There are many passages that you wish to quote and teach the students. Teachers and school administrators can also make better decisions based on reliable information supplied by the book.Compared to Jensen's other books with even more illustrations, I hope this book could be improved in the next edition. E.g., can you make sense of the following? &quot;Research suggests that fonts with serifs (referring to the short lines stemming at an angle from the upper and lower ends of the stroke of a letter) increase reading speed rates when compared to sans serif fonts (without seifs).&quot; (p. 10) A sketch of the anatomy of the brain would help for visualising many terms throughout the book. E.g. in &quot;Gender Differences and Learning Performance&quot;, unless you have some background already, it would be hard to know what is being compared (pp. 69-71). Of course you can start with other introductory books first. Overall, this is a very valuable and interesting book for all educators.
Summary 2: This is an excellent resource, and while primarily written for the elementary or secondary school teacher, there are plenty of suggestions and scenarios for parents too. The book focuses on what can be done to encourage smart learning. There is some mention of the research, but again, the focus is on the ""how"" and not as much on the ""why"". It does not try to be a book on the psychology of learning, but a how-to book to improvement in learning.Experienced teachers will find themselves agreeing with many of the points made in the book, but there are quitely likely additional techniques and strategies to incorporate into your everyday toolbox. For the younger teacher, this is an excellent way to add a few more years of experience under your belt, with very much less effort.I most heartily suggest this, but more importantly share this information with your colleagues. No man is an island, and it is not very effective to be the only one teaching: ""learning smarter"".
Summary 3: I am very pleased with this order. The book is like new condition, the shipment was puntual.Thank you!Bobby"
0809599236,The Two Destinies,"Summary 1: I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded.
Summary 2: When you start the book you'll expect to read Mary's story. You'll know her story but you'll just read here and there from her. You'll know HIS complete and utterly story but none everything of her's. The love story is thrilling in some parts and boring at some points. You would read the same story with a different spell about many times. If you have this in mind you could like the story more than I do.
Summary 3: Ok.. I Love the story.. it is a beautiful romance .. I read it on-line and I wanted my own copy for that cold rainy night get-away. when It arrived I couldn't wait to open it. just to touch the words.. and then Put it in my bookshelf for a perfect night.... WHAT A SHOCK when I opened it to see the POOR PRINTING JOB ... on some of the pages even the lines are askew. black blotches around the words in some cases. and choppy letters not even fully formed on others... WHAT A VAST DISSAPOINTMENT. SHAME ON AMAZON!
Summary 4: This is a well written book that just won't stop. You see the end from about page 20, but it keeps on with the story anyway. It's romance pure and simple. No complicated subplots. By about page 50, you feel like yelling &quot;What are you, blind&quot; to the two major characters. Alas they are. Read it if you like a good love affair. I don't."
1414014244,Before You Tie The Knot / Wedding Planner,"Summary 1: I found the suggestions, helpful hints and especially the author's insights to be most beneficial. I would never have thought of all the steps involved on my own and when all was said and done, I received so many compliments from friends and relatives on how perfect the planning and the final outcome of my wedding turned out. I told them all I owed it to the wonderful book I bought ~ Before You Tie The Knot. Absolutely every detail is covered.And they lived happily ever after ~ thanks.
Summary 2: This book would make a perfect gift for the bride to be. I received it at our engagement party and it was so helpful to me.
Summary 3: ABOUT THE BOOK&quot;Before You Tie the Knot,&quot; contributes a collection of information and advice on wedding planning.

7801031989,Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation (Chinese Edition),"Summary 1: I am just starting the study of Mandarin Chinese with traditional characters.I just wish to emphasize what a previous reviewer correctly said: this dictionary is based on simplfied characters, as used in mainland China and Singapore. The radical and character index tables list the characters according to the number of strokes in the simplified character forms. The traditional characters are listed in each entry, but it is not easy to find them if you don't know the pinyin pronunciation or the simplified form. The radical table also has cross-reference entries for the traditional forms of the radicals, but this only helps a little.The other version of this dictionary, Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation, published by Commercial Press, Hong Kong, ISBN 9620702530, is almost the same product, but based on traditional characters, as used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and many expatriate communities. Its radical and character index tables list the characters by the number of strokes in the traditional character, with the simplified character listed in the entry if there is one. The radical table in this version has cross-reference entries for the simplified forms of the radicals. And as the previous reviewer said, this version has nicer printing and binding.I purchased both, but you may not need both, depending on your own requirements.
Summary 2: I have found this book to be very helpful because it has what many Chinese dictionaries do not have: a breakdown of every Chinese character into its &quot;zhuyin&quot; form. Most dictionaries limit their pronunciations to just the &quot;pinyin.&quot; However, in order to pronounce the words as accurate as possible, it is best to use the &quot;zhuyin&quot; form. Knowing the &quot;zhuyin&quot; form will also help if you ever need to look up a word in a Chinese dictionary according to its pronunciation. Every word in this book is alphabatized by its &quot;pinyin,&quot; but it lists each word's Chinese character first, then the &quot;pinyin,&quot; and then its &quot;zhuyin.&quot; One minor thing about the book is how it lists the simplified characters. In most cases it provides the traditional form, but I would prefer it list the traditional characters first. The print is not too small and easy to read. If you need to look up the definition of a Chinese word, then this is a great resource for looking it up using English letters.
Summary 3: Good points:1. You can look up a word by either pinyin, radical, or number of strokes.2. There are lots of obscure characters in this dictionary that you don't find in most others. For example, some characters have been invented to correspond to the name of some single, particular place. Also they have characters like ""',"" which is meant to be ""greenish black.""3. There is Zhuyin notation (used nowhere else in the world except Taiwan).4. Both simplified and traditional characters are in this book.5. Appendices that have things such as dynasty dates and measurements and the Periodic Table.Bad points:1. The obscure characters here are nice (=neat little oddities), but it seems like a lot of space is taken with words that no one uses.2. The organization of the definitions is not as nice as the Martin Manser dictionary. So, the Manser-style would be to have character X, and then subheadings for X1, X2, X3....., where each subheading corresponded to a new word. Under the subheading would be a (1)pinyin with tone marks for both of the characters; (2) sometimes a sample sentence for using the word. There is *something* like that in this dictionary, but it is just not as clear.Overall, this dictionary is useful mainly for its expansion of obscure characters. It's definitely just a translation of the Xinhua Dictionary, and not meant for beginning students of the language.
Summary 4: i got this for my son who wants to go to china. he is pleased and is starting to speak a little of the language already. good book."
0878916954,The Essentials of PL/1 Programming Language (Essential Series),"Summary 1: I haven't seen PL/1, the 3 GL programming language, in years. This little book is like the newer short reference books that we've all grown to love, but they don't have this for old languages like PL/1. Thanks for having this in stock. My job needs this which means that I need this. Thanks so much Amazon!!
Summary 2: This is not a book, its a pamphlet that gives a very terse overview of the PL/I language. Its not a beginners book but a primer for experienced programmers. The only current book on PL/I is ""The New PL/I"" by Eberhard Sturm which is already out of print after being out less than 2 years
Summary 3: I am a IT professional who found myself with a small programming assignment on an application written in PL/1 which I knew nothing about. I took a look at this book online and it looked like a good reference source so I ordered it. The change I needed to make wasn't anything big but this small book gave me the enough information into the command structure of PL/1 to be able to complete my assignment and even add a couple additional improvements to the application client had not asked for but were extremely happy with.
Summary 4: This is a very good book for the beginners to gain a overall knowledge of PL/1 and start making small programs."
1930865155,The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization,"Summary 1: This book definitely has its heart and head in the rightplace, as it recounts the benefits of globalization. But itseems to ramble a little, without ever directly making thecase that free trade, even unilateral free trade, alwayshelps a country, with the country's general publicbenefitting more overall than special interests may be hurt.Don't get me wrong, I think it's a very good book, but itcould be even better.
Summary 2: This book certainly attempts to show the merits of free-trade against the alternatives of protectionism, mercantilism or colonialism. However, Larsson's book left many things unsaid. His analysis is too anecdotal, and if I were a anti free-trader (which I am not), then I could by the same token come out and give a multitude of horror stories that are seem to be the result of free trade.Those of you who wish to buy a comprehensive defense of free trade, this book is not for you. This book is rather a good source of stories and vignettes that would be helpful in a bar argument with the big hairy white guy next to you. Instead, I suggest that you pick up Against the Dead Hand by Brink Lindsey; it is much more comprehensive and gives a concise and accurate history of the struggle to &quot;race to the top.&quot;
Summary 3: Thomas Larsson's Race To The Top tells the story of globalization and its effects upon individual liberties and personal lives around the world. This focus combines idealogies with a global perspective on the flow of ideas, capitol and lifestyles, considering globalization's effects of commerce and politics on changing societies. An excellent account of how world changes are influenced.
Summary 4: I had to read this book for a Business course. Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book. The arguments are based almost soley on Macro and Microeconomics 101 priciples.If you are looking for fuel to support your Free-Trade fire, this book will provide you with many supportive case studies. You have my blessing to read this book."
0890097585,Hitler's Luftwaffe: A Pictorial History and Technical Encyclopedia of Hitler's Air Power in World War II,"Summary 1: This work is an exhaustive study of the Luftwaffe's inventory from 1931 - 1945. Naturally the famous are here: Ju87, Me109/110/262, Fw190, He111/162, but the obscure as well: the Bv40 Interceptor Glider(!), the asymmetric Bv141 observation aircraft, and the He100 fighter. The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning. Over 150 fixed-wing aircraft, gliders and helicopters are combined with an excellent overview of the Luftwaffe from creation to destruction. Additionally, appendices contain the Luftwaffe's chain of command, and a glossary of Luftwaffe-speak.If you are a student of WW2, and particularly the airwar, then you should definitely try to pick up a copy. Highly recommended.
Summary 2: There are quite a few books about this subject on the market, and I rate this one second best. Top of the market in my eyes is 'Warplanes of the Third Reich' by William Green (672 pages!), but this book can serve as a nice companion or indeed as a replacement if your budget is a bit tight. The main advantage this book has compared to William Green masterpiece is the colour artwork, which is sadly lacking in the Green book. The only thing in which the comparison falls out negative against Green is the amount of information about each individual plane, but there is more general information about the Luftwaffe in WW2 to make this up. Highly recommended indeed.
Summary 3: Hitler's Luftwaffe is both a narrative history and technical directory of the German air force before and during World War II. The first half of the book is a chronology and analysis of the operations of the Luftwaffe. The last half of the book is a technical directory of the numerous aircraft produced by Germany between 1930 and 1945.In the narrative history portion of the book the authors trace the development of the Luftwaffe, its successes, and its failures. According to the authors, the Luftwaffe was defeated not so much in the air but on the ground; Allied ground forces captured factories and fuel-producing areas and thus limited the Luftwaffe's ability to fight. The technical encyclopedia portion includes data on numerous types of aircraft which flew for the Luftwaffe including fighters, bombers, trainers, assault gliders, transports, interceptors, seaplanes, and reconnaissance aircraft. One aircraft which caught my attention was the Arado 232. This transport plane introduced features commonly found in modern transport planes: a high wing above an unobstructed cargo hold, tail carried high with full-section rear doors, and a level floor at truck height. The more famous planes of the Luftwaffe (the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, and a few others) are given more attention in both the narrative history and technical directory.In sum, this book is a good balance of historical narrative, analysis, and technical data. The many photographs, color profile drawings, and cut-away diagrams make this book an excellent account of one of the most formidable air forces in aviation history."
0932482201,My Edens After Burns,"Summary 1: Val Kilmer put much of his heart and soul into his work. You can feel his feelings while reading through the poetry. Some of it may be a bit hard to understand if you do not know the man personally but you get the general idea of what he wants to get accross.
Summary 2: Here is both a story and a review: I met someone online who found a signed copy of this book in a thrift store. The odds? According to info I could find online, there were approximately 900 copies of this book created, so I'd call the odds very, very low of finding this book. But it was found and it was auctioned on Ebay. It went for $4500.At the time, excerpts of this book could not only be found here on Amazon (and, as of this writing you can STILL find some samples of the book's contents here) but entire poems were available to see. Short of buying the entire book, one had to be content with reading the poems online. I did.My opinion: They are odd little snippets of words that didn't resonate strongly with me. Those are the facts. Keep in mind, however, that this author was NOT trying to create a bestseller and that this was akin to a self-published book, a work of creativity by an actor. Also bear in mind that the actor himself took it off the market and one can only speculate why. Also, there is a poem in there dedicated to Michelle Pfeiffer, an actress with which Kilmer had a relationship. So there is that. If you are a film buff who collects rare books written by actors and/or like Val Kilmer, this might be to your liking. Otherwise, I'd save the $900 and up for which it is currently selling and watch Kilmer in one of his many film roles (THe Doors, Tombstone, etc).Triva alert: I believe he is related (distantly) to poet Joyce Kilmer, according to what I could find online. Those who wish to know more about that can try and follow the bread crumbs I tried to follow online. There didn't seem to be much out there. I'd appreciate any more info.He did do a book-signing of this book at The Tattered Cover in Denver because a friend was there and told me so. I confirmed this as best I could. This was many years ago.Not much to go on, I know. But you can see parts of the book here, snippets of the poetry and try to track down more online. I had no luck in rediscovering the page that used to contain all the poetry so I leave you with this information, my recollections of what I'd read before and the historical info.You can also read more about this and the sale of the book for $4500, years ago, at my blog here on Amazon.
Summary 3: I'm astonished that this book is available, but I'm not sure that I am glad. It would be wonderful to be able to read it because it is such a personal glimpse into the author's perceptions and creativity. It is always such a pleasure to see a human being as a human being rather than as a ""star,"" to recognize other facets and talents than the ones most publicized and most familiar. To be read rather than seen is, perhaps, more of an homage to human spirit and creativity than to superficiality.I also acknowledge some reticence to invest. If this book were meant to be a personal gift for loved ones, I would be intruding into the author's personal life, subverting his original intentions, and violating his boundaries. I have to stick to my values. If I value the feelings and privacy of the author more than my own interest, I need to refrain.I would love it if the author felt comfortable enough to share this work with the public, but I don't want to disrespect this person's boundaries.
Summary 4: I have never been interested in poetry until I learned that one of my all time favorite actors, Val Kilmer, wrote and self-published his own book of poetry in a very limited edition copy run. Supposedly there were 2000 released, but I've heard rumors like many that there were in fact only 100 published. Either way, the man is a genius in many ways: his acting, singing, humanitarian ventures, poetry writer and most importantly loving father. I was so inspired by his book that I wrote my first poem. It is a bit daunting to read and try to attempt to understand the poems if you are new to this sort of literature, but never the less inspiring. The poems are from the late 80's during his rise to fame including subjects about love, work, nature and more. If you are a Val Kilmer fan and can find one of these limited copies, it is definitely a keepsake! It definitely brings out your intellectual and emotional sides and it's a shame that it's so challenging to find; however I also heard a rumor that this was originally intended just for holiday gifts for his family and friends and if that's true, it's sad that he didn't share it with the world. We need role models and poetry for the younger generation. I was lucky enough to find a copy that was signed and inscribed to someone in 88'; the year I graduated high school. So, for me, it's sort of a 22 year late graduation gift to myself, lol, not that I could have afforded it back then. If you are a fan, do yourself a favor and find a copy before it's impossible."
0939968029,Hieroglyphs for Travelers,"Summary 1: Through this wonderful compact book and its exercises, readers are able to identify the names of pharaohs and their queens. They will actually translate curses and other inscriptions, and will be transported to Egypt with short visits of the pyramids, the sphinx, the Temple of Hathor at Dendera, the Temple of Hatsheptsut at Deir el-Bahri, the Colossi of Memnon, the Luxor and Karnak temples among many other monuments. In only 120 pages, the authors briefly explain the ancient Egyptian religion and the most important gods and goddesses. They also deal with hieroglyphs and their spelling and translation, reading numbers, and even a little hieroglyphic grammar. There is an answer page that provides a key to the various exercises. A short bibliography and chronology are provided at the end. With several black and white illustrations, this book is a must for any trip to this fascinating land, whether accompanied by a guide or alone.
Summary 2: Based on the recommendation on this website, I took this book to Egypt this past summer 2001, and was glad I did. By learning to recognize just a few hieroglyphs and pharaoh names (Ramesses II kept popping up!) the different sites seemed to come alive. I was not just touring famous sites and being lectured too, I was attempting to understand the sites myself. It was really a great feeling. Our tour guide (a PhD student) asked to see the book that he saw me peering into almost every day. And, yes, the copy was sturdy and lasted from Abu Simbel to the interior of the Great Pyramid. Although my cargo pants were not large enough to acommodate it - the book was about 1/2 inch too wide. (Maybe that's the difference between male and female pants?) I thought seriously about trimming the pages so it would fit, but never got around to it.I had not studied any hieroglyphs before, but this book was great even for me. Pretty easy to understand the basics. I wasn't expecting to decipher the Rosetta stone; I just wanted a chance to see if I could recognize something!If you really want to be engaged in your tour, rather than be a passive tourist, take this with you.I only gave it 4 out of 5, however, because I did find a couple of editorial mistakes, and they were not clear about how even the simplest pharoah names could vary, but that's not a big deal.
Summary 3: I was surprised that such a small book - it is a pocket guide that is actually pocket-sized! - could hold such an ample amount of information. The text is concise without coming to the point of being enigmatic, and is replete with a quantity of valuable data on inscriptions, translations, etc. In the span of four or five pages are presented the names and cartouches of many of the royalty. Presented as well are translations for other monument inscriptions. As someone who has studied hieroglyphic, I can whole-heartedly recommend this book as an invaluable aid to fill in the gaps. It is 'sine qua non' - absolutely indispensable, for both journeying and armchair travellers to Egypt.
Summary 4: There is so much great information in this little book! I've used it to learn hieroglyphs myself, and have also shared it with the elementary students I teach. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in Ancient Egypt.
Summary 5: &quot;Hieroglyphs for Travelers&quot; by Mudloff and Fellows is a lovely pice of work. It is truly pocket sized, as advertised. I do have a couple of minor criticisms. Firstly, the photographs should be in color. It would have a lot more &quot;punch&quot;. I know that would would double the price, but it would be worth it! Secondly, I don't don't think it was necessary to turn it into a text book, with tests. I think that would be very intimidating to the average tourist. However, I do look forward to a further, expanded volume (with tests and color photographs). It doesn't have to be pocket sized."
B000MCFRL8,The Dragonling (A Springboard Book),"Summary 1: The Dragonling and its sequels remains one of the best examples of high fantasy for young people that I have ever had the pleasure to read. It is engaging and fun enough to keep younger readers interested, and beautiful enough to be appreciated and enjoyed many years later. The characters are dimensional and understandable; the plot is gripping, new, and a great deal deeper than it appears on the surface. These books first introduced me to the concept that dragons did not have to be brutal animals OR plush and ridiculous characters. The dragons form an important part of the story without degenerating into sidekicks.The story takes place on the world of Zoriac, in a village that has for generations been defined by the dragonquests--ritual hunts undertaken by the men of the village to ""protect their families"" from the threat of the nearby Valley of Dragons. Derek, the young protagonist, desperately wants to go along with his brother Clep and his father, but is still too young to take part. Discovering an orphaned dragonling with the corpse of its mother, the boy makes the decision to take the little creature back to its home--a decision that sparks the ire of the villagers and eventually a perilous adventure involving kidnapping, the last remnants of a species, a barbaric kingdom in the mountains, slaves, superstition, an outcast king, and one boy's journey to teach his people the truth about their predjudices. A truly stirring story!The Dragonling books skillfully replace the required romance aspect of adult high fantasy with the notion that boys and girls can be friends and equals. Apart from that detail, these books have every bit as much scope as the other fantasy greats; I simply cannot recommend them highly enough. I hope that any future readers out there will enjoy them as much as I have!
Summary 2: My little girl is a HUGE dragon and dinosaur fan. This book, although she read it for school, she loved it. We read it once every 2 weeks, she now has certain lines memorized and loves to read it with me.
Summary 3: DragonlingsThink heavens the men are back from hunting dragonsThis book is about a kid who found a rare baby blue dragon. He's trying to save theDragons from his Dad and the tribe. Because they slayDragons. That boy is also trying to get the dragon a Mom to take care of the dragon.I think the author purpose for this book is that it doesn'tMatter if your different or not .I give this book 5 stars because if you like adventuresYou should read this book DragonlingsbyDawson"
0817454012,The Perfect Portfolio,"Summary 1: &quot;Perfect&quot; This book was incredibly helpful. I am just beginning to put my portfolio together and this book helped immensely. I found out what type of photos I should have, how they should be displayed, etc. Great Book!
Summary 2: This is a worthwhile purchase. Initially I hesitated buying it but the information is extremely helpful even for the most seasoned professional photographer. If you are starting out this is invaluable.
Summary 3: great book. helped me a lot with getting my portfolio together although a little outdated. Enjoy.
Summary 4: It was good, but spent more time discussing specialization and career direction rather than actually how to make your portfolio. I was expecting more of a guide on presentation and content, not a guide on what to shoot and why you should or should not specialize with a glossing over of the physical building of a portfolio for the purposes of presentation.There aren't many definites presented. Most things are treated several ways, leaving the reader to decide often without a clear idea of what is &quot;recomended&quot;. (Example: tray of slides, yes or no? Answer in the bood: well, some people expect to see that. Others don't. You should have it. But a lot of places don't have the equipment to project it, etc., etc.)In short, it was good information, but the author simply refused to take a stance on what works and what doesn't. Instead, the popular options were presented."
B000MU8370,Halloween Parties : How to Throw Spook-Tacular Soirees and Frighteningly Festive Entertainments,"Summary 1: I rarely write reviews, but after I received this Halloween book, if you would even like to put it in that catagory, I felt I needed to save anyone from buying it!An avid celebrater of Halloween, I thought that I had to have this boook for my collection--the title itself was SO catchy. After looking at it, the book was returned.Words cannot even describe the dissappointment I felt after glancing through it. Boring, old, uninviting, crafty suggestions. If you are looking for a good Halloween book for the not too crafty or the not too gory, games, treats, decorations, try 101 Halloween Ideas.
Summary 2: This book is perhaps not well named. It is NOT about spooky spectacular Halloween parties. You won't find creative decorating and innovative costume ideas. Rather it is a nice recipe book for adult dinners, fun cocktails, and elegant place settings for a seasonal supper party. It isn't a one-shop top for your Halloween party ideas, but I really like some of their magical spell ideas, and their fun dinner and drink recipes.
Summary 3: we just love halloween and we like this book cause it has some very cool things to make and we like to add different things each year. plus it is a very fun way to get the whole family involved and have some fun and grow stronger. thanks
Summary 4: This is one of those books that I like the *idea* of, but not so much the execution. It's gotten to the point where if a book has the word ""spooky"" (or a variation) on the cover, I'm just going to assume it's not. The idea - offering ideas for six themed parties - would make for an excellent book if they were all actually Halloween-themed. Sadly, even the Halloween-specific party suggestions fall a little flat.
Summary 5: I'm a huge Halloween fanatic and own quite a few books on the subject and I'm always looking for more with new and fresh ideas. This would be a good book for someone who is into the retro theme as the book seemed like it focused soley on that, but because that's not for me, I was sadly disappointed in this book. But if retro is your thing, it had some nice ideas. Nothing new in the recipe section either."
0312267908,Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892,"Summary 1: There was a time I didn't much care for Whitman's poetry -- what seemed to me its self-conscious pretentiousness was a turn-off. (Whitman himself acknowledged that his style was all-too readily parodied.) It was only when, 30 years ago, I heard Rip Torn read it, I began to acknowledge its power and originality. Nevertheless, I was still bothered by an overly self-aware, ""straining for effect"" quality -- until I found this collection.Gary Schmidgall has done what should have been done a century ago. His collection, comprising half of Whitman's poems (about 80% of the total number of lines he wrote), restores them to their first versions in the correct chronological sequence.We now hear Whitman speaking to us with his original animal vigor. Whitman himself admitted this: ""...there was an immediateness to the 1855 edition, an incisive directness, that was perhaps not repeated in any section of poems subsequently added to the book: a hot, unqualifying temper, an insulting arrogance (to use a few strong words) that would not have been as natural to the periods that followed. We miss the ecstasy of statement in some of the after-work...""More significantly, Whitman's subsequent emasculation and de-sexualizing -- to confuse and obscure the issue of his sexuality -- is removed. Whitman's originals are often more graphic, more-bluntly sexual. It's easier to see why most critics were offended. It's unfortunate Whitman's changes to ""Leaves of Grass"" made it less controversial. Perhaps the Schmidgall edition will encourage libraries that ban ""Huckleberry Finn"" to also ban ""Leaves of Grass.""If you haven't read the original, 1855 edition of ""Leaves of Grass"" -- as well as Whitman's unsigned (and bluntly meretricious) reviews, and the contemporary reviews of academic critics -- you haven't read Whitman. I was especially moved by the last few pages of ""Song of Myself,"" which I had never read.Schmidgall includes a copious quantity of notes, excerpts, and reviews. The material from Whitman's notebooks make it clear he knew exactly what he was doing -- creating a new, original, wholly American poetry not modeled on Classic, European, or British forms -- and why. If America is the land of self-definition, Whitman was the first American poet to make that self-centeredness the focus of his works.This edition is a must-own for anyone with the least interest in Whitman. Or dis-interest, for that matter. You might change your mind.
Summary 2: What are characteristics of Leaves of Grass that are uncommon in literary masterworks? It was originally published anonymously. It was originally self-published. Whitman paid to have it printed & bound. While most books are published and never significantly revised, ""L of G"" was a lifelong work in progress, revised repeatedly, changing as the author changed. There are many ""Leaves of Grass"" publications for sale. I recommend this version for the following reasons:a) The poems are presented in groupings, showing the development of the poetry collection over Whitman's lifetime, from the brief 1855 first edition, through the many different editions, up to the expansive 1991-92 edition. This edition focuses on the first version of each poem before Whitman's later versions ""toned down"" some of his verse.b) In addition to introductory comments, this edition includes the various prefaces, unpublished introductions, & ""A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads"" from the original ""L of G"" publications.c) It includes Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous congratulatory letter and Whitmans' reply letter.d) It includes contemporary reviews (including those written by Whitman himself) from 1855 to 1891e) It includes a historical timeline of Whitman's life.f) It is a large page format, easy to read, splay out, underline, and write in the margins.g) It includes one version of many of the Leaves of Grass poems. If this version also included many of the revisions, showing the edits of the poems, I would like this version even more (look at Bartleby's online for more information about the various versions of each poem).Leaves of Grass is ""too much"" for many people. It can be critiqued as hyperbole and excess. To suggest it is not in praise of overt sexuality would be like suggesting to mothers that babies still come from storks. To suggest it is not about homosexuality and bisexuality would be like suggesting 101 Dalmations isn't about puppies. In fact, when I think of Whitman, the word ""too"" is the most common word that comes to mind. He is too ____ (fill in the blank).What inspired this man to create this landmark American sexual and emotional statement? Many things. Paramount among those things was Loss. Loss of old loves: ""Doubtless I could not have perceived the universe, or written one of my poems, if I had not freely given myself to comrades, to love."" and ""(I loved a certain person ardently, and my love was not return'd; Yet out of that, I have written these songs.)"" Loss of Lincoln inspired ""Drum-Taps"" and ""Sequel to Drum-Taps"". Loss of youth, health, & pleasures inspired him to write. And I think he wrote for the 4 purposes George Orwell suggested writers write: Sheer egoism, aesthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse (""to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity""), and political purpose.Whether or not Whitman's perspectives are correct or good, he said things that most people have feared to say so strongly. His words have been criticized as base, vile, and shameful, but they are also free speech expression. I don't know if I can say I'm a big fan of Whitman, but I can say that I'm glad to live under laws that have allowed him to speak his inner mind. And I promote environments & protections that safeguard such expressions.Following his beloved Abraham Lincoln's assassination, he mourned without reservation, ""O Captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells . . . For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning . . . My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still; My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will."" As ""Dead Poets Society"" so capably conveyed, ""Leaves of Grass"" is about passion - unabashed American passions.
Summary 3: To date, I think I own about four different copies of Whitman's grand opus ""Leaves of Grass"". One is a deathbed edition, printed in 1922, that is hardcover yet pocket sized and great for a backpack. The second is an 1855 reprint of a ""first edition"" sold by a major bookstore chain. The third is another 1855 reprint in paperback. And now the fourth, which is this one, and without a doubt, the best of the bunch!Walt Whitman, throughout his years, wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass many times, for each subsequent reprint. Much of the later editions of the book become watered down and less potent, according to editor Gary Schmidgall, of which I heartily agree. The final ""deathbed"" edition of Leaves of Grass, released around the time of Whit's death, varies tremendously from the rich dance of the first edition, in fact, the first three editions.After reading Schmidgall's amazing book, ""Walt Whitman: A Gay Life"", you come quickly appreciate Whitman's 1860 edition of the book, the third, released just before the Civil War. Upon searching for a copy of this book, it's virtually hard to find, and I ended up downloading some of the poetry off the Whitman archives website. But Schmidgall painstakingly has recreated that edition, rebuilding such moving sections of the book like Calamus.It's in Schmidgall's edition that the true genius of Whitman comes alive. He becomes more real, more in depth, and shows more pain than in any other edition I've read. It's too bad that Whit decided to censor his writings as he aged, for he tends to weed out the roses with the dandelions. Schmidgall replants Whitman's glorious garden, and we, as readers, get to reap the visual brilliance of it all.
Summary 4: I was an English major and WW was always one of my top five poets. His work is nearly peerless. That said, the only anthologies of his work that I could find were so academic and over-edited that I never had the privilege of reading his ACTUAL words until I picked up this edition in a small bookstore. I had no idea how 'racy' his poems were, but as you read it you realize how much passion he had for the subjects he wrote about (the body, Abe Lincoln, sex). I'm glad I hung onto my Modern Library edition of his works so I can compare it to this and appreciate how much more 'real' his words come across in this edition. If you've always been a WW fan, buy this, you won't regret it.
Summary 5: Nothing to add to the excellent reviews above--this is the truest and best version out there--but the paperback cover is flimsy and warped almost immediately. I recommend getting the hardback, used or otherwise."
1552093670,Multiple Sclerosis: The Facts You Need (Your Personal Health),"Summary 1: I bought this book two days after being diagnosed - it was so helpful in understanding what was going on, how to deal with specific symptoms, what to watch out for, etc. It also explained the treatments - from the steroids to the ABC drugs. I sent sopies to my mom and dad because they were freaking out over the whole diagnosis and I didn;t have enough strength for all of us. Knowledge is power and this one gives really good, up to date info - something critical in managing this disease.
Summary 2: i was diagnosed w/ MS last friday and my doctor basically spent 20 minutes total with me - that included looking at my final mris, doing a reflex test, throwing 4 perscriptions at me and saying yes, you have MS, go talk to the nurse to get IV steroids started. it was a terrible experience but i gladly had already ordered this book and a few others from Amazon and this one in particular i read from cover to cover to try to understand what was happening and what the next steps are. it gives a good overview of what ms is, how its diagnosed, what the causes are thought to be, managing and treating the disease according to symptoms as well as the interferon drugs, and it ends on a hopeful note which i needed at the time. this disease stinks but knowldge really helps you feel a sense of being in control rather than a victim. after reading it i sent copies to my parents to help them understand more too.
Summary 3: I have read many resource and reference books over the years, and this is by far my favorite. Easy to read and understand, my questions have yet to go unanswered. An absolute must for the newly diagnosed, and a great quick reference for those of us more experienced.
Summary 4: When I was newly diagnosed this was one of the first books I bought. It helped me to understand terms used in MS, and also knowledge that gave me a small sense of control over the disease. Knowledge is power, and this helped me gain that feeling.
Summary 5: This is one of the best books ever written for the patient. It explains in clear and concise language all aspects of concern. I have it close at hand and anytime I have a question, 9 times out of 10 it is in the book. A must read for a newly diagnosed person. I call it my bible of MS. In it is a brief history of the disease and right up to the most up to date treatment options. Absolutely love it.
Summary 6: If you only buy one book about this horrible disease, this is the one. Written by an MD in an easy-to-understand style."
B000MW9Y62,Mom Kills Kids and Self,"Summary 1: ""Mom Kills Kids and Self"" was an unassuming book I saw on the library shelf. Intrigues by the title, I picked it up and opened the cover. The book sucked me in with the first few pages. Our main character, never named, has returned home to find his wife has killed herself after murdering their two sons. What unfolds afterwards is looking through the eyes of a man driven to insanity by this act. His behavior and actions are strange and unexpected as his thoughts fantically trace back through time, trying to find the cause of his family's death. Everything in this story is juxtasposed, from his perspective on his wife's life, his boy's lives, and from his own life, from his work, aand from his philosophy on women. The story kept me captivated, I recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a combination of King and Vonnegut.
Summary 2: He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul .
Summary 3: As an aspiring writer I am aware that this book has its flaws, but I love it regardless. The story haunts me. I can go years without touching it, but still I think about its unnamed protagonist often. And when I do go back to the book, the ending leaves me utterly flabbergasted each and every time; this even though I have never forgotten what happens.The funny thing is, I have tried reading another book by Alan Saperstein, and I found it truly dreadful and put it down soon after picking it up. But there is something about Mom Kills Kids and Self that I just cannot get enough of. It is a chilling experience, to see inside a man's head as he goes insane--as he lives inside his house alongside the bodies of his wife and children for days.I love the thought of someday publishing a book that reaches a wide audience, that makes a lot of money. But then I think about this book, and I know I would give up that fame and fortune just to know that my work has touched someone so profoundly as this one has touched me."
0974576719,Manjack,"Summary 1: I can't believe they finally put something like this on audio. It is a very unique audio book which goes to the heart of the matter and never lets up until the last word is read. The stories are well written though some are better then others. The best is Phone Sex track two on CD 1. It truly is funny and quite sexy at the same time. Bob vickery has a talent for showing the erotic side of men on men attraction but also the humorous side as well. His description of the sexual acts are vivid although somewhat repetitive in nature. There are six gay erotic stories presented here read by various male readers who really are the stars of this production. They really get into it; sighing and moaning and exclaiming where appropriate. I really enjoyed listening to them and what fun it was to listen to this kind of stuff while riding a bus or having coffee in a shop. Some of the stories even aroused me thanks to the reader's ability to put me in the middle of things. I was literary laughing out loud with ""Phone Sex."" Mr. Vickery also makes sure that safe sex is the standard of the day and thus where penetration is concerned all the men are wearing condoms. As enjoyable this audio book was there are a few minor complaints. The stories on a whole while exciting are quite vanilla in nature. There isn't even one three way story in the whole book. Mr. Vickers rarely strays away from the buff torso types with flaring big knobs. A better variety of bodies would have given the anthology a more realistic feel. It's not just the buffed muscular men who have sex after all. These types may be Mr. Vickery's forte but they are not the only gay men in town. On a positive note he at least dispenses with penis size say for the last story. It is left up to the listener's imagination to determine how each man is hung although he does a fine description of each man's body. I found this audio book a refreshing and welcoming product which was long overdo. I hope this is the start of a new trend to put erotica on audio and to make more gay books available in this format. Highly recommended but not for the prude. This book contains two CDs and features various narrators which deserve applause.
Summary 2: I've been a big fan of Bob Vickery's since his ""Cocksure"" and ""Playbuddies"" books, and I love the fact that he's offering his stories on CDs now. It's a great idea to have actors narrate erotic stories, and I just wonder why nobody else seems to be doing this. All six stories are hot, and it's hard to choose which one I like the best. Maybe ""Giving Phone"", a story about two guys on a phone sex line (with all the sound effects) getting more and more into their dirty talk. ""Brother John's Traveling Salvation Show"" is good too, about a drifter who trades sex for rides, and the clueless high school wrestler in ""Helping Rufus"" is not only extremely sexy, but funny too. The other stories are great too. I've been listening to Manjack in my car, and it makes the commute to work a lot more fun.
Summary 3: I have been reading these one hand friction books for awhile. Bob Vickery is among the top, if not the best, writers of friction books. Now Bob Vickery comes out with some of his stories on CD. I wonder why no one else has thought of this? You just have to listen to the CD one time and you know that the old adage is true, two hands are better than one."
156458027X,"National Audubon Society North American Birdfeeder Handbook: The Complete Guide to Attracting, Feeding, and Observing Birds in Your Yard","Summary 1: This book is a really nice reference book for the backyard birdfeeder. It's not just a bird identifier book, it has chapters on bird survival and behavior. I'm glad to have it my small bird library and refer to it often.
Summary 2: ...to receive this fine book! Trying to identify the birds visiting my backyard feeder with old field guide books was not working. They simply had too much information geared for experts. This book is nicely laid out and clear, offering tips for attracting, feeding, watering and identifying the birds visiting your backyard, as well as instructions for building bird houses, feeders, and so on. I put several of the ideas to use immediately! If you are an amateur backyard birder, this is the book for you!!
Summary 3: This lovely DK (Dorling Kindersley) has the trademark vivid photographs on every page. Detailed information on discouraging squirrels, plans for making your own feeders of different types and lists of various birds you can attract using various methods.Each bird page has a detailed photo of the bird, a map of the United States showing where and when you can see the bird, behavior and description of sounds and songs, nesting habits, and the best kind of food to attract and benefit the birds you want.Information on bird baths and nesting boxes is also provided.A great resource for those who love to have God's creatures in their yard, but don't know the best way to attract them.
Summary 4: I am a beginner backyard bird watcher and I really enjoyed this book. It has some great pictures to help you identify birds, or even just to look at. The book doesn't stop there, however, it gives you nice detailed information of bird behavior, sounds, nests and habitat. I recommend this book to beginner or intermediate bird watchers.
Summary 5: This purchase was made as a replacement for a copy that was ruined when it got wet. Exactly what I wanted."
0842382836,Degrees of Guilt: Miranda's Story,"Summary 1: The notion of three different books by three different authors about the same story, each from a different character's perspective is new to me. I'd enjoyed the Diary series, and thought it was worth picking up the three books just to see how well the concept worked.I actually thought the books by the other two authors were better than this, but only by a small margin. They are all excellent, and reading the same story three different times never got boring because they are all so different, while remaining consistent.In many ways it's so true of life - we really don't know what's going on in other people's heads, especially when it comes to subterfuge and illicit behavior.Three different authors, three different characters, three different styles, one terrific story.
Summary 2: Review by Gigi HoffmanMiranda Sanchez is (what she thinks) a boring high school senior--honor student, editor of the school paper, athlete. She decides to stop being so stuffy and loosen up a little. Her mom, who prefers to be called Shelby, is always telling Miranda to lighten up and have some fun, so Miranda sets out to do that. She begins drinking, starts going to parties, and has fun with her good friend, Kyra. However, Sammy, Miranda's friend and kind-of crush, objects to Miranda's new partying phase.Miranda is confident she has everything under control. She's practically a grown-up, after all. But her partying leads to a big disaster with Sammy, leaving her distraught and heart-broken.In Carlson's book, the story is told from Miranda's side. The writing seems straight from a teen's perspective and tragically realistic. I really felt Miranda's pain and wished that the ending could have been different, but like Miranda discovers, sometimes life doesn't work that way.
Summary 3: This books is very very awesome.Miranda is a supposed good-goody, and when she's told to ""lighten up,"" she does so. She takes drugs, throws outrageous parties and gets drunk.When a very vlose friend of hers dies at one of her parties, she's guilt tricken and wants to committ suicide.Does she do it? Read and find out.It's an amazing book that a person should read.
Summary 4: Unfortunately I didn't read this book. My daughter read it very quickly, so I'm thinking it must have been a good one."
1566913780,Foghorn Outdoors: Northern California Cabins and Cottages,"Summary 1: I found this book to be an excellent resource. Not only does it provide a wealth of information about available cabin and cottage rentals in northern California, but it provides concise and helpful information concerning recreational opportunities available near each cabin or cottage. I found the book to be well written, easy reading and very user friendly, and I was astounded to learn that there are so many cabins and cottages available for rent in neat places. If you enjoy more privacy than is afforded in motels and bed and breakfasts, you need to own this book.
Summary 2: I own Tom's camping books and really value them. I bought this book to find cabins for me and my wife to get away to. This is covered in fairly good detail but I take exception to the inclusion of KOA camps that have cabins. I also did a quick web search for a cabin in the certain area and found several not mentioned in the book. While he doesn't claim this to be an exhaustive book I think more options should have been listed in certain areas. This is a good introduction and exposure to what's out there. But you need to do some personal digging to find your own gem possibly not mentioned here.
Summary 3: This is a sensational book! I don't want to sleep on the ground. I want a bed and privacy. My husband wants to go fishing and golf. This book gives us the opportunity to do trips together and make both of our desires come true. So far we've tried three of the cottages, and they were just as Stephani &amp; Tom said they were. Sounds like they have the dream life!"
0813026202,E-mails from Scheherazad (Contemporary Poetry Series),"Summary 1: Mohja Kahf's poetry collection is better than prozac. Her poems link classical Arab characters with current day capitalistic trends (""Zuleika meets the Marlboro man across a delayed green""), and are punctuated, in the book's first half, with sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant Hijab Scenes, where the author encounters everyday prejudice but moves beyond self-pity and anger to humor and celebration. The result is charming and ultimately empowering. The first third of the book tells the plight of the immigrant- the Arab Muslim in particular- and uses the metaphor of landing on the moon. The second third is an ode to women and womanhood, and made me lift my head a little higher when I left the bookstore (this book under my arm.) The last third is a beautiful dialogue on political currents and events, and the poem in which Matisse characters come to life is jaw-dropping. The poetry collection offers something rare and brilliant as a stone: an intellectual journey from which one emerges with voyager dust.
Summary 2: &quot;E-mails from Scheherazad,&quot; by Mohja Kahf, is an excellent addition to the multiethnic body of U.S. poetry. A short bio at the end of the book notes that Kahf was born in Damascus, Syria, came to the U.S. as a child with her family, and has attained the rank of associate professor at the University of Arkansas.Kahf's poems cover a number of themes: the immigrant experience in America, cultural difference, women's issues, war, violence, and poetry itself. There are several poems that deal with the issue of the veil traditionally worn by Muslim women. A good representative poem is &quot;My Grandmother Washes Her Feet in the Sink of the Bathroom at Sears,&quot; a striking story of cross-cultural tension.Kahf's language is passionate, sometimes witty, and always clear and accessible. Her poems are richly spiced with many cultural references: to Wal-Mart, Robert Frost, Lt. Uhura, the &quot;Rubayat&quot; of Omar Khayyam, MTV, etc. She is particularly searing when reflecting on living in a post-9/11 world. Her compassionate but critical eye captures both the joy and tragedy of life. Highly recommended for college classes, book circles, or individual reading.
Summary 3: Mohja Kahf speaks to my heart, most powerfully, and with such beauty and humor as to make the bitterness go down easy. I love this book."
B0007K76UU,Language,"Summary 1: So what if it was published in 1935? Bloomfield's &quot;Language&quot; was perhaps the first work of linguistics I ever read, and the principles laid down in it are good and enduring. For linguistics, it's even relatively easy to read, which is saying quite a bit. The emphasis on Amerindian languages may date the text for some readers. I've read the book a number of times, and never without marveling at the treasure house of knowledge it contains. If you have even a passing interest in languages and their development, you should read at least some of Bloomfield.
Summary 2: It's in very good condition when it arrived. I really like it. It is exactly as the picture shows and meets my expectations perfectly.
Summary 3: This book is a true classic, and anyone interested in linguistics and language should have a copy. It should be noted that since it was originally published in the 1930s, some of the information may be out of date, but most of it isn't. The field of linguistics has expanded since then, but this book is still very relevant, especially the parts relating to borrowing, language change, philology, etc. This book is also great in its scope. It's detailed and gives examples, but it reads well and gives a good introduction to a broad field."
B000P4AJEI,Miss Pickerell Goes to Mars,"Summary 1: One in a series of charming science adventures for youngsters. Miss Pickerell goes to visit her pet cow one morning and finds a rocketship in the pasture! It's a mission to Mars, and a curious Miss Pickerell finds herself accidentally locked inside! The science is a tad bit dated, being written in the 1950's, but the adventure and fun will introduce scientific concepts to children and may even awake an interest in science. There are many other Miss Pickerell books, in which she visits the Arctic, space stations, lunar colonies, and goes diving in an atomic submarine! Charming fun and adventure with a science backdrop is all too rare. Though a bit out of date science-wise, Miss Pickerell's adventures are sure to be treasured by youngsters. Also an interesting read for nostalgic adults, believe it or not.
Summary 2: Miss Pickerell's worries are few: keeping her cow happy and finding enough new rocks for her award-winning rock collection. Yes, her worries are few...until she finds herself on a rocket ship to Mars.This children's book, first published in 1951, does indeed show its age, but it also retains its charm. Miss Pickerell's light adventure is a delightful way to introduce children to some very basic scientific concepts: gravity, space travel, magnetism, and more. Sure, the science is quite dated, but Miss Pickerell is a treasure.Still waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out? Miss Pickerell might be just what you're looking for.94 fun pages
Summary 3: I found this book in the public library in Washington Heights in New York city when I was a child. I read everyone of the Miss Pickerel books that were available at that time. Glad to find this again, as this one was my favorite.
Summary 4: Miss Pickerell is a spinster with a cow, a love of rocks and a very old car. The story opens with her taking her nieces and nephews to the fair and exhibiting her rock collection. There she meets Mr. Haggerty and gives him a ride. It turns out that Mr. Haggerty is to be the navigator on a space flight to Mars and the ship is currently parked in Miss Pickerell's pasture. This upsets Miss Pickerell, but her curiosity overwhelms her and in a major mistake, she replaces Mr. Haggerty on the flight to Mars.This story is generally silly science fiction; the crew demonstrates incompetence to the point where Miss Pickerell has to come to their rescue. I read this book for the first time when I was in elementary school and even then found it laughable. There are many books for the young person far superior in their descriptions of space flight."
B000JQ0R7G,Blood,"Summary 1: &quot;Blood&quot; is a well written, somewhat contemporary view of Moorcock's Multiverse Mythos. The backdrop is an imaginative future America (patterned after the Post-Civil War U.S.) where the mining of a power source called &quot;Color&quot; has created a tear in the fabric of reality. Entropy runs rampant and we get an idea of what would happen if the War between Chaos and Law spilled over into OUR world. But the perspective is fresh and incorporates some modern physics such as &quot;fractals&quot; and &quot;scale&quot; to add a degree of science to the fantasy. Even the Gods of Moorcock's Pantheon have been recast as both players and characters in a hugely complex RPG called the &quot;Game of Time.&quot; After a somewhat slow start, I found myself really sucked into this book. It's a tough read and can be confusing at times, although it pulls itself together nicely towards the end. It's basically a fresh spin on classic Moorcock. The sheer creativity of &quot;Blood&quot; shows why Moorcock was, and still is, one of the pioneers in Fantasy/Fiction.
Summary 2: Okay, it's not the Cornelius books (my personal favorite), it's not the Elric saga, it's not really even Corum, but hey's this is Michael Moorcock we're talking about here. What we seem to have here is Moorcock attempting something new with his tried and true concept of Law versus Chaos and the multiverse and spinning it into something different. So we're faced with a drastically different South where the war between those two opposing factions has basically spilled over onto Earth. Into this comes a bizarre cast of characters such as Jack K (not even attempting that last name), Sam Oakenherst and the Rose, who all wind up being sucked into the Game of Time, whether they want to or not. The book turns out to be highly confusing in parts and the beginning is quite slow, introducing the characters and barely moving the plot forward while doing so. However once everyone gets together and things start happening, the book takes on an almost breakneck pace, almost like it's trying to compensate for the sloth like start. Ideas fly fast and furious around here even in the slow moments, and it sometimes feels like Moorcock is trying to cram several books into one. Surprisingly, I found myself actually caring about the main characters, especially the driven and passionate Jack. Toward the end the book takes on a careening quality, not at all helped by the rather strange Corsairs of the Second Ether sections, which, while good at introducing situations and characters that will become important later in the book, are deeply weird and border on incoherent. The book is almost contradictory, on one hand his descriptions and situations (especially the Second Ether) are almost brilliant in conveying the strange nature of these places, but sometimes you can barely figure out what's going on because so many ideas are being thrown at you for what seems to be little reason. It's a readable, highly enjoyable book which seems to polarize fans something fierce, judging by reaction. Some of that might be because this is such a radical departure for the multiverse concept and something he would run with in other books, but with a little fine tuning, a pretty good book could become a near masterpiece. Give it your time though and you'll find many small rewards to be found.
Summary 3: Blood is a book that seems to have too many interesting ideas. Sadly it never focuses on any one of them long enough to become interesting. Too many elements seem to have been tossed in without having any impact on the story, stretching suspension of disbelief beyond all bounds. The attempt at &quot;non-linearity&quot; simply creates a jumble that, while ultimately having a certain underlying logic, is not a very entertaining or engrossing read.
Summary 4: This is a very baroque South. Sam Oakenhurst is looking to encounter a lost love, the Rose. The Roe has her own strange agenda.The same can be said of the best of the best of the jugadors, Jack Karaquazarian, who is also looking for a lost love. More importantly though, for such a gaming talent, there is the Game of Time.The Game of Time will have important consequences for the multiverse."
0975533150,Guilty Pleasures - Historical Erotic Romances,"Summary 1: Pita's characters take us on an all consuming, passionate exploration of love and sexual desire from around the world, utilising cultures and centuries we can only imagine.Maria Isabel Pita takes us through a collection of 18 erotic stories which capture the enthusiasm and passion of different women throughout the ages, with astounding precision. The author displays an unusual, albeit ingenious, imagination that opens the book with Out of Control, a short story set in futuristic Canada 2015. It's difficult to suggest favourite as I enjoyed them all, however, the stories which stand out the most include my literary trip to 1636 Transylvania, in Song of Blood, reading of the Secret Societies in Italy, 1500's, through to the year 3000 B.C, Crete in The Double Axe. Oh yes, then another solar system, Star Crossed and then a final pit stop in a parallel universe, Light After Breath. Should you wish to read from the last tale to first you can, as they are standalone stories, and can be read in any order.What I liked about Guilty Pleasures is that with each tale comes a new premise, amalgamated with historical facts and wonderful, descriptive exposition. Every character is written with a fresh, unique outlook on love and life appropriate to the chosen historical era. This fact alone, hooked me from the first sentence, or at least the opening paragraph of each story. Ms Pita varies the pace of her writing, in a well-planned effort to intrigue and arouse the reader. All in all, Maria's ability to mix the erotic pursuits of her characters with entertaining, sometimes shocking twists and turns, ensures a believable, dynamic ending to each self-contained story. Out of the whole collection, there was only one story where the denouement wasn't quite as surprising (or perhaps interesting) as the rest, but that's not a problem, just a different style.It is clear from Maria's writing, she a talented erotic writer who holds a passionate interest in history and their correlating cultures. Some of her stories are slightly peppered with an S&M; flavour, but more often than not, the true sadistic behaviour of her characters are indeed the main source of nourishment and sexual satisfaction. These stories capture a mixture of cruel, sensual overriding power, and exotic scenes; intensifying the creative suspense of an exhilarating read and all consuming passions, not to be missed.
Summary 2: Maria Isabel outdid herself with this anthology of erotic short stories that span the world, time, and those oh so so naughty thoughts and deeds that make erotica so much fun to read .....The 18 stories covering the authors musings' over the years from Toronto in 2015, Zanzibar in the 1800 to Egypt in 1000 BC are also so varied,from the gentlest of stories such as 'The Bride of Christ' where the author totally captures the sweet innocence of the erotic daydreams of a young nun in Portugal in the 17 hundreds, to 'Song of The Blood' a HOT 'no holds barred' erotic, deadly and blood filled sexual perversion of a warrior prince and his 'pit bull on steroids' wife, in Transylvania in 1636.For my particular tastes, 'Secret Societies' from Italy in 1500's is probably some of the best erotica that the author has written.....very much on par, if not better than the best of Eururopen erotica authors over the years....Avery very enjoyable diversion for any mood .... WOW
Summary 3: Though some of the works here are better than others, such as ""Milagro"", and ""The Integral"", Ms. Pita offers enough of a variety with a master's stroke that most tastes will be satisfied.
Summary 4: After reading Whips & Whispers by Pita (a truly fantastic book that I strongly recommend to anyone interested in BDSM romance/erotica), I was extremely anxious to read more by her. To my shock, as wonderful as Whips & Whispers was, this book was absolutely awful. The stories are extremely short and barely erotic. On average, they contain about 90% set up (bland discussion of the characters, scene, etc) and 10% ""action"" - sexual or otherwise. The interactions between the characters are minimal and superficial, left almost entirely to the reader's imagination. When a story begins to show promise, it ends - leaving the reader to tell any actual story (a task typically assumed by the author).After reading Whips & Whispers, I am beyond shocked by how disappointing this book is. I also purchased Angela's Wolves, figuring that I could take a chance for $0.99. Sadly, Angela's Wolves shared the same flaws as this book: all set up and detail, minimal story that ends after the very first page that finally shows promise. Literally, my responses to the final pages (in Angela's Wolves; the final paragraphs of each story in this book) were ""okay, this is finally going somewhere good, I will continue reading after all,"" and then, less than one minute later, ""or it's just stopping, before actually telling a story."" Again, beyond disappointing.I strongly advise that you do NOT buy this book. Based on Angela's Wolves, I strongly recommend that you not buy ANY of Pita's cheap books ($3 or less). I suggest you proceed with caution before buying anything from Pita, with the exception of Whips & Whispers, which I recommend as one of the better books in this genre.
Summary 5: I love historical novels, and that's what I thought this book was, with the added bonus of naughtiness. What I got was a book with stories (I read 3 of them before I gave up)that had to be written by horney 13 year olds. This single purchase has me rethinking my loyalty to Amazon."
0373271875,Brand - New Heartache (The Oklahoma All-Girl Brands) (Silhouette Intimate Moments),"Summary 1: Wade Armstrong spends thirteen years proving himself to the small town of Big Falls, Oklahoma. He won't be happy until he's the most successful businessman in town, and owns the biggest house on the highest hill so he can look down on them all. Too bad Wade procrastinated too long before signing the contract for the house of his dreams. When he arranges to meet the real estate again, Edie Brand shows up as well. His efforts to sandbag her purchasing the house backfires, and now she's moving into the house he wanted.Edie left L.A. when her contract as a lingerie model was fulfilled. Speculation abounds, but tabloids failed to trace Edie back to her hometown. She's kept a low profile, but the stalker that drove her out of L.A. finds her, leaving a &quot;gift&quot; of handcuffs in a plain box in her mother's kitchen. She doesn't tell anyone of the numerous &quot;gifts&quot; and letters the stalker sent, or just how threatening they have become. The threats drive her out of her mother's house and into a place of her own so she can protect her family from lurking danger. And now Wade has taken it upon himself to protect her.Book two of The Oklahoma All-Girl Brands miniseries continues the excitement with pizzazz in BRAND-NEW HEARTACHE. Maggie Shayne presents a vividly realized, fast paced novel with extraordinary characterizations and a terrific plot. When opposites clash, Edie and Wade find that have quite a lot in common, beginning with hidden interest stemming all the way back to high school. Secondary characters are likewise believable and enchanting, including a mother who's never wrong and an empathic sister who sense energy flows. A fabulous read, BRAND-NEW HEARTACHE comes very highly recommended.
Summary 2: I liked this story of two people who misunderstood each other in high school but come to rely on and love each other later in life. Wade is an appealing hero, and Edie is vulnerable without being weak. The story was well paced and kept my interest. Shayne's Brand stories continue to be enjoyable.
Summary 3: When Evie Brand comes home from L.A.,an ex-model running from a stalker she seems to get on the wrong side of Wade Armstrong ,someone who's been in love with her since high school, someone who's help she needs and wants even though she does not want to admit it. This is the second book in the all-girl brands series it 's not as good,it does not hold you all the way through it only picks a little at the end and you can't feel a whole lot of empathy for the character.THE HEROINE IS JUST SELF CENTRED AND BORING AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT THE HERO SEE'S IN HER BESIDES THE FACT SHE IS A MODEL THE HERO DESERVED BETTER."
0323014275,Veterinary Board Review (CD-ROM),"Summary 1: I bought this cd and have been disappointed from day one. First of all, there are only 200 questions per section (5 sections) which means you will be through this cd in less than a weeks time....you'd be better off buyng the book set instead. As well, when you take the mock exams you will soon discover that they have cut corners once again and have recycled questions from the previous sections into the exam. This does not test your knowledge, it tests your ability to memorize. When you're done your exam you can look at which questions you got right and wrong, but be careful because once you quit the cd, all that info is lost and you'll never get to see your precious exam marks again! All in all, i was thoroughly dissapointed with my purchase and would have been better off without it. By the way, i haven;t even written my board exam, so i am not blaming this cd for poor exam results...yet!
Summary 2: I found this CD to be a great resource in addition to just reading, reading, reading. There are pictures and x-rays and the format gives you a chance to practice taking an electronic exam. Some of the questions are repeated, but it helped me focus on areas I needed to work on most. I passed my boards the first time, and I know this CD helped.Dr. C
Summary 3: I think this has been a helpful study tool to help prepare for the NAVLE. I like how you get the answer immediately after you answer the question and it gives you a brief explanation. If you did not understand the question or explanation, you were able to go look it up. It helps to realize the type of questions that are going to be on the exam."
B0006XUZ7O,Violin : six lessons,"Summary 1: This is a really phenominally detailed synopsis of six lessons of basic technique with Yehudi Menuhin. It is definitey not for beginners though. All levels of players can benefit from the information in this book. It starts with stretches and works its way through how to hold the instrument and use the bow. No matter how ong you have been playing, emphasis on the basics like this is always good to review periodically because we all fall into bad habits. Should be on everyone's shelf right next to Simon Fisher's ""Basics""
Summary 2: These lessons are very concise and precise about a broad of basic elements on violin playing technique, excellent for violin players of any level!
Summary 3: The response time was really excellent. However the address for sending was not the one i opted for. It sent to another of my addresses. a pre-confirmation before sending would be helpful. Such pre-confirming coul be done after aorder but before sending and time limit could be set for Customer re-confirmation."
1593540035,Pea Pod Babies,"Summary 1: This is a very sweet book. I bought it for my GBG triplets. My triplets have very different personalities and like the Pea Pod Babies have many of their own unique adventures. My kids love this book and so do I!
Summary 2: Love the book and we just insert our kids names sometimes when we read it to them. Each of the peapods personalities fits one of our kids so it really is a fun book to read to them
Summary 3: The book was in great condition and it is a great story, but the seller neglected to include that their was a personal note inside the cover.
Summary 4: Karen Baicker is a fantastically different and fun author. Collect all her books--they are worth it.
Summary 5: We just received this lovely book about three very different peas in a pod. After lots of cootchy-cooing from mummy and her friends and all of the samey-samey stuff that triplets often receive sweet pea, snap pea and snow pea break away and have fantastic adventures. This beautifully illustrated tale celebrates individuality, especially for multiples. We plan to donate a copy to our school library when our triplets are a bit older!"
0735104379,The Dutchman,"Summary 1: I first heard of this book about a year ago when the co-authors, a husband and wife team from New York were interviewed on t.v. I enjoy historical fiction and really enjoy mysteries; it's not often you can find both.""The Dutchman"" takes place in New York City in 1664 when it was called New Amsterdam. The Schout (sheriff) Pieter Tonneman is trying to solve a couple of murders during the time when the people of this ""small"" town are also concerned about the invasion of the English. Although one might think a story of this time is dull or stuffy, it is not. It's very interesting. The authors also throw in little known, but interesting facts. For example Wall Street was there from the very beginning, but not as a financial center as we know it now. It literally was a wall used as a protector against invaders. Also it tells about an island close by called Brueckelen, which is now Brooklyn.When I first started looking for this book, it was very hard to find. It was already out of print, although it had been published in 1992. I couldn't find it in bookstores , nor in my library. But now I see it's available in hardback and paperback here on ... (this website). So if you like a mystery that has a little different twist and can find a copy I suggest you try this book out.
Summary 2: I enjoy history and this historical fiction was terrific. Having grown up in the NYC area, I found the historical aspects very informative. The plot was complex but engaging. After reading this book by Maan Myeyers, I went on to read the entire series. A very good read and I recommend it.
Summary 3: We ordered this book as a Christmas gift for a relative from his Amazon wishlist and paid $4o.oo plus dollars for it and still have not received it!!! We are trying to figure out how to receive a refund. Something went wrong with Amazon and its services over the holidays, because our adult daughter (who lives at a separate address and has a separate Amazon account)also ordered this book(which is out of print)for the same relative not knowing that I was doing the same and Amazon did not remove it from the wishlist of our relative. Afterwards, not knowing that our daughter had ordered it previously, I ordered the same book from the same relative's Amazon wishlist, paid for it, and Amazon said it would arrive at my home between Dec. 23, 2010 and Jan. 10, 2011 and we have never received it! Also, I ordered and purchased three Kindle books from the same relative's wishlist as Christmas gifts and they were not removed from his Amazon wishlist either (even after a week). Finally, our relative removed the items he had received on Christmas from his Amazon wishlist himself, so as to prevent any further confusion. The book may be excellent, but we will never know!"
0486401707,Angels and Cherubs Stained Glass Pattern Book (Dover Stained Glass Instruction),"Summary 1: This book gives you 60 stained glass angels and cherubs that can be done in a variety of art forms. The patterns for the most part are very detailed in the wings and flowers within the patterns. These patterns are not for beginners because of the amount of detail.
Summary 2: When I ordered the coloring book filled with stained glass patterns, I thought it would be a great collection to my stained glass workshop where I have literally hundreds of patterns of stained glass angels. I was looking for something to build a stained glass panel from and these so called patterns don't follow the basic concepts about the way glass naturally breaks. I realize it's a coloring book, but I did expect it to be a bit more realistic. It's not even that I can't modify the designs, but I was so disappointed because I'd wanted something special to build in honor of family members who have passed away.
Summary 3: I like to paint on glass and love Angels. This box has great patterns. I have used it a lot and the angels are great to paint."
0811201104,The Cosmological Eye,"Summary 1: When it comes to wrtiting with style, itensity and telling the whole truth, Miller is the best America has to offer. ALL his books are worth reading for the nuggets of honesty and intent...
Summary 2: I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller. There are many great examples of his works, without the commitment of an entire book. Henry really has a handle on what it means to be human.
Summary 3: if it was written by henry miller, it was written from the heart, making it a great work, automatically."
B0007FMIY4,The Century vocabulary builder,"Summary 1: People are judged by the words they use. IQ tests are based in large part on how many words a person has in his or her vocabulary. When others hear people speak, they judge them by what you say and the words you use to say it. This free Kindle book was compiled by G. Greever and J. M.Bachelor. The book is written for common people, not scholars. The book does not contain a list of vocabulary words. It focuses instead on how to use language correctly and effectively. It discusses such things as the emotions of certain words: should one say sodium chloride or salt? The volume contains helpful exercises. The authors stress that improving vocabulary requirs a lot of effort: one must fight battles to subjugate the words. The authors begin their presentation with a discussion why it is necessary to improve one's speach and writings. It includes a discussion on the power of words to do such things as selling what you want to sell. The book teaches such things as how to compress what you are saying into the shortest most effective way to express what you want to say. It tells how to make an idea concrete and how to avoid figurative language that is not clear.
Summary 2: I can only say I love this little book! Not only is this very practical, it is full of sagacious statements I quote in my classroom. I have both the Kindle version and the 1950 version.
Summary 3: This book basically gives you the history of words and how they were established. It was not what I was looking for! Not a good read!
Summary 4: Boring, poorly set up, no dynamic or real plan to sit down X number of hours a day and cover Y amount of material so you can become exponentially more glib. Just a poor attempt at a primer.
Summary 5: I do not remember buying this product nor is it on my library shelf, but I can only imagine it is a good product and worth the money. Plus it can help you improve your vocabulary. On second thought, I think I downloaded this as a free e-book. Anyways, buy it or have it. It's better to have more to read than too little to read. That is my motto. Any vocabulary mistakes made on this review may have been intentional or unintentional and refer back to the utility and practicality of the book."
0899508871,"Frank Marshall, United States Chess Champion: A Biography With 220 Games","Summary 1: I used to have this book, I broke my own rules and lent it to a student and friend ... and he left Pensacola. (I never saw him, ... or the book again. But in his defense, he was in the Navy, and they move those guys around a lot.)I also used to have an original copy of Marshall's book, but I have lost that over the years, too.But the book is absolutely a treasure, I borrowed a friend's copy to do this review. (For accuracy's sake.)I am too young to have known the man. (I played my first chess tournament in 1966.) But I knew Mr. Marshall's wife (Carrie) quite well. For many, many years; she was the lady who sat at the foot of the stairs and greeted you as you walked into the Marshall chess club. I feel very badly - I wish someone had told me who she was the first time I visited there. The Marshall's are a HUGE part of the history of the game of chess, at least here in the U.S.What do you get when you buy this book? Quite simply one of the very best chess books ever written, at least in the area of a (chess) biography. It is very clear and very obvious that this book has been researched to a level I personally have never seen before.By comparison, I am interested in history and very fascinated with several figures in history, notably Abe Lincoln and Andrew Jackson. (Among others.) I have read virtually every book I could get my hands on about these two persons ... and in the process I have found literally hundreds of mistakes. (One authors' chronological record itself was ridiculous, he had Jackson - MANY TIMES!! - in two different places at the same time!)But in Soltis's book, I have yet to find a single error. This might be because Marshall himself left a tremendous amount of material behind. He wrote several books, kept journals, and filled literally hundreds of yellow legal pads with notes of his own. And the people who actually knew Frank Marshall told me he had a fabulous memory.The former secretary of the club personally told me that Soltis spent hundreds and hundreds of hours there, pouring over records, making notes, and making copies of the material that is available there.The result? A simply fabulous book that is virtually free of errors. I am NOT saying Andy made no mistakes, every human does. But Andy has worked VERY hard on producing a document/book that is about as error-free as any person could humanly try to do. Andy has gone well above and beyond the call of duty here.""What about the book,"" you say? Well, it too is beautiful. A gorgeous hard-back book that is nearly 400 pages in length. 220 very deeply annotated games. Additionally, there are DOZENS of game fragments.Personally, I do NOT think you would buy this book if your only interest was to improve your game, there are simply too many other good books devoted to that subject. (Check out the books by Capa, Reinfeld, Watson and Yermolinsky.) No, you would buy this book for many reasons - maybe because you consider yourself a Marshall fan. Or you consider yourself a student chess history, and want to learn more. And maybe you think you might benefit from studying one of the greatest tactical players the USA ever produced.All the bases are covered here. A thorough index, photo's, match and tournament record ... quite simply there is not a topic or subject here that you can't think of that Soltis has not covered in great detail. (On page # 203 you can find Marshall's famous victory over Levitsky, Breslau; 1912.)The only topic that I could not find was the list of Marshall's best games; perhaps Soltis did not feel qualified to make that judgment. You have over 200 of Marshall's games here, so after playing through them all, you could do your own list. (My own choice would have to come from one of the games from his monumental win at Cambridge Springs, 1904.)If you are a fan of Soltis, as I am ... or want to learn more about chess history, then get this book. I will say no more.
Summary 2: GM Andy Soltis certainly knows how to write fine books, and this is one of them. Even non-Americans should appreciate a book about this US Champion who was also one of the world's top 10 for almost 30 years.The book covers Marshall's life set in its historical context, and also lightly annotates many Marshall games, including some draws and losses. Marshall was famous for his combinational ability, but Soltis shows that he had confidence, with good reason, of being able to outplay many opponents in the endgame.Marshall's skill should not be underestimated although he lost matches decisively to Lasker and Capablanca. He won the enormously strong Cambridge Springs tournament of 1904 ahead of then world champ Lasker. At St Petersburg 1914, he was one of the five finalists, and Tsar Nicholas II awarded these players the original grandmaster title. In the mid 1920s, Marshall showed that he could cope with the new hypermoderns. Even in the 1930s, when his strength had lessened somewhat, he captained to USA team to victory four times at the Olympiads, and the USA teams have never risen to the same heights since.
Summary 3: I think Frank Marshall fans will find this book invaluable,it features many of his best games and plus it gives a good biography as the book progresses, perhaps the games could use some more notes but what is there is good enough."
B000NXIRKY,Models of Revelation,"Summary 1: This classic work of a beloved Catholic theologian and cardinal boils down and categorizes the work of dozens of prominent theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, from the 19th and 20th centuries into five models. It is indispensably useful as a primer and for such reason is widely read by graduate-level theology students studying revelation.One strength of Dulles's book is that he does not merely summarize the positions. He critiques each position, trying to identify both its positive and negative points. This does not mean they are all equal, and his critique of the third and fifth models mentions how they are difficult to reconcile with traditional Christian beliefs. Dulles does not advocate a specific model, nor does he think that the models can simply be combined (since they arrive at different positions on specific questions). Nor does he think creating a sixth model is viable at the present. Instead, he wants to improve upon the models by critiquing them in light of the other models. A clear way forward is not presented. That would be a miraculous feat, to reconcile such diversity!The first (1) model (Revelation as Doctrine) could be called the conservative or traditional model, which is worked out by both Catholics and Protestants in the 19th century over against the theories of Rationalism. This model sees the Bible as a collection of factually true statements about God and humankind. In some ways it is made official Catholic dogma at the First Vatican Council, though not in a way that totally excludes the following four models. It is also the model generally used by Evangelical Protestants today.The second (2) model (Revelation as History) is also worked out in the 19th century in deliberate reaction to the first model. According to this model, the Bible itself is not revelation but merely witnesses to revelation. Revelation itself is the acts of God in history (e.g., the Exodus, the Incarnation). The famous scholar Oscar Cullmann (1902-1999) belongs to this school, as does Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928- ). The former popularized the German word Heilsgeschichte, which is usually translated ""salvation history."" Jean Cardinal Danielou, the famous patrologist, created a Catholic version of this theory, which found its way into the Second Vatican Council's document on revelation, Dei Verbum.The third (3) model (Revelation as Inner Experience) is essentially the view of Liberal Protestantism, whose founder may be Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), though the model is worked out by later scholars. This model sought to establish a theory of revelation in which revelation was not dependent on the Bible, which was considered historically unreliable. Instead, revelation is coterminous with a personal religious experience of God, which can be mediated by the Bible (though it can also exist outside Christianity). One living author who falls here to some degree is John Hick (1922- ), who, however, can also be placed in the fifth model.The fourth (4) model (Revelation as Dialectical Presence) is what is sometimes called Neo-Orthodoxy, as developed after World War I specifically by Karl Barth (1886-1968), Emil Brunner (1889-1966), and Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976). It is a reaction to Liberal Protestantism. According to these Protestant theologians, God is ""absolute mystery"" and cannot be objectified. The object of revelation is not God himself in his absolute essence but God as he turns toward his creatures. Revelation is nothing but the fact of Jesus Christ. As in the second model, the Bible itself is not revelation, but witnesses to revelation.The fifth (5) model (Revelation as New Awareness) was the most difficult one for me to wrap my head around. According to Dulles, in this model revelation is ""the transcendent fulfillment of the inner drive of the human spirit toward fuller consciousness."" It is a sort of evolutionary view, in which humankind is moving toward ""fuller consciousness,"" and this is what revelation is. The very famous theologians Paul Tillich (1886-1965) and Karl Rahner, SJ (1904-1984), are to some degree associated with this school of thought.After going through the five models, he tackles specific questions (for example, the Bible, the Church, Christ, eschatology) and shows what answers each model arrives at. This is, again, very useful for the beginning theology student. Overall, this book is on the short-list of must-reads for students of the theology of revelation. No doubt it could be critiqued by theologians of each school of thought, but it is inevitable that a book of this nature will not please all, and many simplifications are necessary to fit so many theologians into only five models, which Dulles himself acknowledges. Something is sacrificed in the name of utility and simplicity, but it is an acceptable sacrifice for the beginner.
Summary 2: ...there's still much good information to be had. My theology professor had us write papers explaining why Dulles's portrait of the evanagelical model fell short, but I really don't think it was bad at all, considering the religious orientation of the author.Dulles does an admirable job of portraying the doctrine of revelation from several viewpoints, so this book should come in handy to anyone interested in the nature and thought of revelation.
Summary 3: Avery Dulles defines ""revelation"" as ""God's free action whereby he communicates saving truth to created minds, especially through Jesus Christ as accepted by the apostolic church and attested by the Bible and by the continuing community of believers."" In Models of Revelation, Dulles identifies five models of revelation: Revelation as Doctrine, Revelation as History, Revelation as Inner Experience, Revelation as Dialectical Presence, and Revelation as New Awareness. He explains that the propositional view of revelation to which he links Conservative Evangelicalism and the propositional view of Catholic neo-Scholasticism both fit within his model of Revelation as Doctrine. Dulles' view, however, does not paint a complete picture of the ""Conservative Evangelical"" view of revelation.Dulles traces his description of the Conservative Evangelical view of revelation to the views presented by B.B. Warfield, through the defenses of Gordon H. Clark, J.I. Packer, J.W. Montgomery, and Carl F.H. Henry, to the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy's ""Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy."" Dulles concludes that this view holds that God makes himself known through nature (natural or general revelation), but that salvific truth requires supernatural (special) revelation. Natural revelation makes God ""available always and everywhere."" Special revelation provides for effective knowledge of salvific truth because God's tanscendence and the devastating effects of original sin prevent humans from attaining a sure and saving knowledge of God by natural revelation alone. God's revelation is deposited in the canonical scripture, so the Bible is the whole and final revelation of God, thereby allowing revelation without prophets, Jesus Christ, or apostles.Dulles finds that the ""propositional model stands up well in terms of its faithfulness to tradition, its internal coherence, and its practical advantages, but less well when judged by other standards."" He also notes that it promotes unity through its doctrines, provides firm doctrinal standards, facilitates full commitment to biblical and ecclesiastical teaching. This model ""safeguards the meaning and authority of revelation, which is seen as providing clear, firm answers to deep and persistent questions concerning God, humanity, and the universe, and thus as offering sure guidance through the confusions of life.""However, Dulles concludes that this model provides too narrow an approach, that it is authoritarian and extrinsicist. He criticizes its as implausible, inadequate to experience, and as valueless for dialogue. Dulles believes that this model requires submission to propositions in the Bible held to be revelation, regardless of whether they seem to apply to the believer, thereby ignoring the believer's own life and experience. Its apparent rigidity stemming from its acknowledgment of Holy Scripture as the complete deposit of revelation rejects ""members of other groups as heretics or infidels."" Because he doubts the authority of every passage of Holy Scripture as God's word, Dulles questions this model's treatment of the Bile as peremptory authority. Nevertheless, Dulles does not imply ""that the clear teachings of Scripture and the creeds are without grounds in revelation.""Dulles clearly identifies the elements of God's revelation in his descriptions of five models. What he views as the weaknesses of the Evangelical's conservative model, presumes his bias that Holy Scripture, without the Church through the pope, is incomplete. He discounts that the conservative model actually accounts for the role of history, experience, and faith because of his desire to ""compartmentalize"" God's revelation. Nevertheless, Dulles' analysis does lead to the conclusion that God's revelation is important to the believer because it conveys God's nature and purposes to the community of believers."
B000FQ7OWQ,The Gospel According to Matthew: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale New Testament Commentaries),"Summary 1: It is difficult to rate this fairly because you have to ask about the intended audience. If you are looking for an in-depth scholarly treatment of Matthew, this would be 2 stars. However, that's not the scope of this series. I've used many Tyndale NT commentaries over the years, and it is a very good series, but not as in-depth as NICNT, NIGTC, WBC, etc. With that said, France does an excellent job commenting on the kinds of questions people turn to a commentary for, and not spending too much time on the blah, blah, blah, that fills the pages of so many commentaries. While you aren't getting all the details, you are getting the fruits of top-notch scholarship. It's a great commentary, given its scope.
Summary 2: Though all the commentaries in this series are not equal, this is very good. His exposition of Ch.24 is well argued, even if you don't agree with his conclusions.
Summary 3: The book I ordered was exactly as described and delivery was even faster than promised."
0060975121,A Low Life in High Heels: The Holly Woodlawn Story,"Summary 1: A madcap race through the sixties, and a must for those who are into pre and post stonewall sixties, and all of the mayhem that was involved. This is one of the best additions to gay and lesbian history, because for once it gives credit due to one of the first trans-gender actors in cinema history (Andy Warhol's Trash).Holly gives us the gift of what it was like living amongst all of the glitter and the headlines of the pop culture decades...being picked up (as a homeless person) from your squat in a limo only to have lunch with Diana Vreeland (an event Holly once told me about when interviewed) shows that all it takes is the right shade of lip colour and some chiffon and off you go! Holly was the third in the trinity of Warhol girlettes that paved the way for RuPaul, Lady Bunny, and even you and I to be able to live our lives, and to be free.One will want to grab a cocktail, and share in Holly's memoirs of her race, to beat the sandman as she went from one life inspiring moment, to a piece of queer history. Thanks Holly, for sharing with us!
Summary 2: I'm a big fan of the Warhol Superstars and the ""underground"" films he made in the late 60s and early 70s. Holly Woodlawn is one of Warhol's most beloved and long-lasting of the superstars. She really only stands out in one film--""Trash"" but it's a performance so memorable that it's all she needs for everlasting underground star status. This book really captures the ""Woodlawn Persona."" Wisecracking, self-depracating, uncouth, dishy, bitchy, delightful! It's proof positive that Woodlawn is her own greatest creation. How much credit should go to the ghostwriter (billed as ""with Jeff Copeland"") I can't say. But Holly graciously gives him plenty of credit--and whatever his input, he certainly knows how to write in Woodlawn's ""voice."" The Holly Woodlawn story is like no other. She was a product of mixing with the right people and good timing and a ballsy attitude. It could have only happened in the 60s and Holly certainly took advantage of all the crazy things that era had to offer. This book is a romp. An epic. An extraordinary journey. I recommend any admirer of camp, pop art, or orignal, madcap personalities to read this.
Summary 3: This is a great read. It's a little sad at times because of the intense poverty and addiction that Holly went through, but over all it's a lot of fun to read.... what a life she had!"
1574883283,Record Breakers of the North Atlantic: Blue Riband Liners 1838-1952,"Summary 1: Well illustrated with many seldom seen photographs, paintings and drawings, ""Record Breakers"" is a excellent account of the quest for speed on the North Atlantic. Kludas' text is informative and at times technical without being dry or difficult to read. Each Atlantic record breaker since the SS Great Western of 1838 is described in detail and depicted with an original profile drawing, most of which are in color. Some notable ships are covered in less detail even though they were never record breakers. A small section tiled &quot;Super-liners that never were&quot; covers several shipbuilding projects which were never completed.Liners of all eras (Kludas identifies three distinct periods of Atlantic steam travel) are covered more or less equally, and thus the ten 20th century liners have fewer pages devoted to them than the 26 19th century ships. Just the same, the coverage of the newer ships is excellent and includes little known facts and aspects of each. Strongly Recommended.
Summary 2: Kludas worked for 18 years in a Hamburg shipyard: his background lends to Record Breakers Of The North Atlantic, a beautifully illustrated history of blue riband liners from 1938-1952. Chapters blend a history of specific liners with black and white and color photos and illustration, providing a colorful examination highly recommended for any fan of nautical history.
Summary 3: This 1999 German book, translated into English in 2000, is well balanced between informative text and wonderful art. It is illustrated with very nice black and white photographs and color drawings. Each ship covered is illustated with a side profile - I'm not certain, but each of these profiles looks like it is drawn to scale with all the others in the book, which visually shows how the shipbuilder's art has progressed over the years. Accompanying each profile for each ship is a specification of the ship and a brief career history.Note however, that the book is MUCH more than these little profiles - I just found them to be a nice added touch, just like I found the photographs of each man responsible for each ship's construction. The chapters are broken into into intelligent historical periods and the text and illustration captions are informative and smart.The book conveys the pride that the people (and governments!) associated with these vessels had for their ships. As the author states, the Blue Riband was never a formal competition. As a consequence, there never was an official history kept about it. However, this book does an excellent job of filling that void.
Summary 4: This 1999 German book, translated into English in 2000, is well balanced between informative text and wonderful art.

Summary 5: This is one of those standards that ocean liner enthusiasts must have. The information is great, the photos and layout are well done, it's a great book all the way around. I highly recommend this one."
087614282X,Louanne Pig in the Mysterious Valentine (Nancy Carlson's Neighborhood),"Summary 1: Louanne Pig is ecstatic when she receives a Valentine's Day card from a secret admirer. However, she is now faced with trying to un-mask her admirer, so she can thank him in person. After all, having a secret admirer is very exciting. So Louanne sets out on her quest to find her admirer, but it's harder than it looks, and Louanne keeps hitting dead ends. Now she'll never know who her secret admirer is.Nancy Carlson has done a wonderful job of creating an adorable Valentine's Day book for young readers, in which they can identify with the character. Her short, yet sweet prose on each page is easy-to-understand, and her lovely illustrations depict what is going on perfectly, making it easy for even the youngest reader to know what is going on. This is a splendid new book for children, that will make a lovely present, whether it's given on Valentine's Day, or any other day of the year.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper
Summary 2: I bought this book to read to my son's first grade class for Valentine's Day. I was disappointed with the book to say the least. Every character that Louanne ""investigates"" as her possible secret admirer reacts to her very negatively. I think the story could have been told without shouting, name calling, food being dumped on her head and knockng her down. I would have much preferred more positive outcomes from each inquiry she made and don't think it would have detracted from the story at all. In a day and age when we lack positive role models and struggle with ill mannered children, a book that reinforces that these behaviors exist and are acceptable is a disappointment. The only saving grace of this book is that it presents an opportunity to teach and emphasize that these behaviors are not acceptable.
Summary 3: Louanne the pig has an age-old problem: She's received a beautiful valentine from an unidentified admirer! Whimsical drawings accompany her search through all her classmates, and the ending is sweet enough for those to young to appreciate boy-girl romance."
0451210549,Fever Cell,"Summary 1: This is one of the best medical thrillers I have read in a long time. Goldberg is a favorite of mine and I was looking forward to this one.The story basically centers around its main character Dr. Joanna Blalock. She and some of her co-workers get exposed to a deadly virus, brought into the country by terrorists.Goldberg is great at describing the action in a quick, witty manner. This book never drags and although I still feel as though they make the main character a little too perfect, she is an engaging character.If you get easily spooked by viral scenario that are all too plausible in &quot;real life&quot;, don't read this.However, is you want to get scared and find a truly enjoyable read, then buy this book.
Summary 2: As of now, this is Leonard Goldberg's last book in the Joanna Blalock series and, in my opinion, the best yet. It deals with a very touchy subject: Smallpox &amp; Terrorism and bits of 9/11 are added in the book as well. Joanna Blalock, a forensic pathologist at Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles is called in by the FBI to do a top secret autopsy of an unidentified man found murdered at LAX, Joanna and Jake fear that they are once again being pulled into another terrorist investigation; the previous one having nearly cost Joanna her life. While the investigation into the corpse's identity is in progress, another emergency intervenes when a man with symptoms of smallpox arrives at Memorial and everyone who has had contact with him is quarantined in the hospital's basement isolation center; including Joanna.Based on a scenario that has all the makings of a very real nightmare, Leonard Goldberg has put together a top notch medical thriller.
Summary 3: This was a very interesting book about bioterrorism in the U.S. Leonard Goldberg never disappoints as Joanna Blalock and her crew figure out what is killing people before it gets to them.
Summary 4: Again, Leanoard Goldberg in my eyes is a master of medical thriller fiction!! Joanna Blalock is a great character as are all his other regulars in the Joanna Blalock series!!
Summary 5: I obtained this book accidentally, and read it for lack of anything else to read. As a general rule, I don't like medical mysteries and I don't like science fiction. However, Dr. Goldberg surpasses both of these genres, and I am now hooked and a dedicated fan."
1931055068,Aging Defiantly: Meeting the Challenge at Any Age,"Summary 1: This is the real deal! Aging Defiantly tells it the way it should be. If you plan on living a long life-you'll need to read this book.
Summary 2: In &quot;Aging Defiantly&quot; authors Peg and Dick Purdue offer fresh insights and sound advice to men and women who want to do more than merely cope with their senior years. In chapter after chapter, each based on obstacles they have faced and overcome,they succeeded in convincing this 78-year-old that a defiant attitude can be a constructive one in meeting the many challenges of aging. Both practical and inspirational, this is a must read.
Summary 3: I was greatly impressed by this book. It has opened my horizons and gives me new hope for the future. The Purdues have laid out a road map on how to live longer and feel better. They point out that age is largely a state of mind and give advice on how to make adjustments so getting older is not a terrifying idea. Thanks a lot, Purdues!
Summary 4: Stomp your feet and clap your hands! Finally, a book to make some noise about! This book addresses the most important issue of our lives-aging. Read it and be enlightened. Read it and live longer!"
0138630364,Newcomer Program Program (Prentice Hall Regents ESL),"Summary 1: Judie Haynes' &quot;Newcomer Program 3-6&quot; will lighten the teaching load of any teacher who works with newly arrived ESL students.The book is packed with comprehensible information for classroom teachers on second language acquisition. It contains 170 reproducibles and information that students will need when negotiating those first months in a new country. Newcomer Program allows you to have lessons which are comprehensible to your newcomers at your fingertips.
Summary 2: I have both the K-2 and 3-6 Newcomer Programs. I find the information for teachers section very helpful for paraeducators in my building, as well as for teachers who are new to having ELLs in their classes. I love the variety of activities to reinforce the BICS as a newcomer gets started on this new journey. I also do some teacher training and was recommending this set to students who were ready to graduate, to have in their professional libraries. I was saddened to discover that they are no longer in print. I have yet to find anything that compares.
Summary 3: Both of the Newcomer Program 3-6 and K-2 books are amazing! It took a very long time to find these books, but I am glad I finally did. I am really sad that these books are out of print. During my ESL student teaching my observation teacher used this book and I loved it. I don't believe in worksheets and don't think the worksheets in this book should be given to students in exchange for instruction. This is a great book to use for direct one on one instruction for students because it is so visual. As an ESL teacher, you will need to teach your beginning students about all of the content inside this book. Thus, this book takes away the hours of trying to develop your own materials. Again, this book should not be used as the only form of instruction, but it is definitely a wonderful supplemental resource....especially for new teachers!"
0373690991,Tongue - Tied (Harlequin Temptation),"Summary 1: Extreme stuttering makes ordinary conversation virtually impossible for twenty-six year old Robin Lee. Her dreams of graduating from college reach a sudden halt when a professor humiliates her in front of the entire class, leading to her withdrawal from the university.

Then in a stunning moment of bold attitude, Robin overcomes her inability to speak by allowing her body to speak for her.Johnny Dayton does not know the horrible day Robin has endured. Nor does he hear the whispered gossip from the students at another table. He only focuses on the legal papers in front of him as he prepares for a board meeting the next day. Then suddenly the most beautiful woman he has ever met stuns him with a lip lock from heaven. When he comes up for air, Johnny recognizes his best friend's kid sister, and suddenly Robin becomes the bridge to a time when life was less complicated and more understandable. And he wants more; a lot more.Colleen Collin's unique approach to communication lends TONGUE-TIED a dynamically erotic twist.

On the other hand, Johnny dislikes himself for the corporate man he has become, but Robin allows him to become the bold thinker had been before pr campaigns determined company lines.Author Collin's meets the unique challenge of a mostly silent heroine with pizzazz, keeping the narrative lively even as she exploits the challenges of silence with grace. She carefully balances the mundane world with a sizzling world where words are unnecessary. Further, she gives her heroine a unique, powerful voice that combines sweetness and heat in a vibrant mix. Add TONGUE-TIED to your keep shelf! Winner of the WordWeaving Award for Excellence.
Summary 2: A little slow start but it picked up the pace.Johnny Dayton was an annoying but likable fellow.Robin transformed surprisingly well.I did not expect to enjoy it this much - thumb up!
Summary 3: A sever speech impediment makes it difficult at best for twenty-six year old Robin Lee to communicate with anyone one on one. Having to stand in front of a classroom as demanded by the University of Denver in several of her classes is impossible for her stuttering has left her extremely shy thus her fantasy of a college degree in literature seems impractical. Even working at the Davey's Diner as a temporary fill-in waitress proves demanding on the TONGUE-TIED woman.When the other students whisper loud enough for her to hear their pity, Robin turns bold and kisses a customer. Johnny Dayton is stunned that this lovely vision is kissing him even as he reviews legal papers for a contentious board meeting the next day. Soon Johnny recognizes that the lips belong to his best friend's kid sister, Robin and that he wants more from her, but her timidity may prove stronger than their growing love.Readers will delight with the way Colleen Collin cleverly blended a verbal communication challenged female within a strong erotic tale of love. Though in this age of the Disabilities Act, readers will question the professor's humiliation of Robin, the story line shows her as a capable person able to communicate in other ways other than verbal. She makes the tale and Johnny is a likable hero struggling between meeting the corporate image and his audacious concepts to improve business. The audience will realize that TONGUE-TIED is a triumph for fans as Ms. Collins pens an enchanting heated tale.Harriet Klausner"
B00086CWDO,"Battle leadership;: Some personal experiences of a junior officer of the German Army with observations on battle tactics and the psychological reactions of troops in campaign,","Summary 1: First of all if you are looking for this book contrary to what the used book sellers are telling you THIS BOOK IS NOT RARE OR HARD TO FIND! YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY $100 TO GET A GOOD COPY...you can get it new for about $4 at the Marine Corps Association book site or wait 4-6 weeks and pay $2.50 +s&h...The book itself is a very insightful report by an officer who obvserved the effects of war on his command. Even though almost 100 years old this is still a great book for any Soldier,Marine, or military historian.
Summary 2: First of all, this book is recommended to be read by all United States Marines by Major General Twomey United States Marine Corps.This book is a prime example of a great leader. This German Officer shares with us a life full of experiences during World War I. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to find out what it takes to survive in a battlefield not physically, but the most complicated of all, the mind. He does explain how you can never prepare yourself mentally during peace time.Ive read this book once, and cant wait to read it again.Marcos TorresUnited States Marine
Summary 3: This is great reading for young officers and battle leaders. It has many stories abut different circumstances and the kinds of leadership that exposed itself during those circumstances.
Summary 4: as a warrior of 9 wars and 89 battlesi have lived alot of the truths this man wrote of, many wars and years beforethe times may change, the principles, do notfor ever true combat leaderthere is no better bookget it, read itand you will know itas the truth always resonateshawke sends
Summary 5: Adolf Von Schell is a combat leader, but his lessons apply to any leadership position. This book is a short read that offers big lessons."
1401028683,Domestic Terrorism,"Summary 1: This book was put into my hands by a daughter with her high recommendation. I have heard of page burners before but I had never read one until now.I spent the night with this book and absolutely could not put it down. It was positively the most exciting story I have ever encountered. I could not wait to get to the next page. I was amazed, excited by the plot, and in high anticipation as to where the story would take me next. I consider myself smarter than the average bear but I was not able to predict this story from the get-go.Wes MacGregor, the star of this story, was everything I would want in a real he-man. I could see Bruce Willis in this part every step of the way. It was exciting imagery and the author, Jay Farrington, for a first book really made this story live. It is so plausible it was scary. This could happen!Great book. Hope there is more where this came from as I will be the first person in line to get another.
Summary 2: A great read w/a uncomfortably plausible story line. Just the fact that children could be used as pauns by terrorism is terrorfying in itself. This book is well written and the characters well developed. Interesting twist throughout the book and a good, ending. Well worth the read and looking forward to more books from this writer.
Summary 3: Somewhere between reality and fiction lies the essence of Jay P. Farrington's compelling first novel, Domestic Terrorism. A real-life street cop, Farrington expertly tells the tale of Wes MacGregor - a street-wise law enforcement veteran whose prophetic vision of the degeneration of America's teenagers comes hauntingly true. Farrington introduces us to child armies who have turned away from their dysfunctional families, to gain the acceptance of a maniacal father figure, hell-bent on exacting his revenge on society in general, and Wes in particular. Ripped from real life events, Domestic Terrorism is a shockingly smart page-turner you won't soon forget."
0310227704,Acts: Build Community,"Summary 1: My Sunday School class has read other Ortberg books. We were looking for a study that would get into Scripture. It doesn't completely cover Acts but pieces of it. The conversation that this study has generated is terrific and as usual for Ortberg, takes you to a higher level.
Summary 2: Nice small group study, or individual. Pushes forward on how you view the Spirit as a companion in your life.
Summary 3: Great discussion in our community group. Confronted (mis)conceptions of the Holy Spirit. Deeper than expected from online book review - much growth for all of us.
Summary 4: good product and good bible study material. learn lots about the work of the holy spirit and how it builds community"
9004119515,"A Companion to Study Virgil (The Classical Tradition: Volume 151) (Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava)","Summary 1: A useful guide to the whole of Virgil's corpus, but it is painful to read. In the second sentence of the Introduction, for example, we are told that ""G. and Aen. in particular have become ... battlefields."" Of course the author means the Georgics and the Aeneid, but the Short Title list appears AFTER the Introduction. For the sake of the reader, should not the FIRST use of a title be the ""long"" one?Consider also the prose-style. Although it is not impenetrable, one wonders whether its worth the effort getting into:""The question can perhaps be answered better at the end of the poem, but it may prove helpful to air it at the outset, in as much as the poet seems, if (conventional or traditional) critics have read the text's explicit rhetoric in lines (say) 1-296 with some degree of insight and understanding, to have been exceptionally generous with his indications of the levels at which he proposes to write and the manner in which he wishes -- or so it would appear -- to be understood.""The next sentence is worse still: ""If that remark is in itself now, in some eyes, a critical fallacy, then I can only say that here I am writing about what I (and the scholars I cite) have seen and heard in the prooemium.""
Summary 2: This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in.
Summary 3: I'll go to the mat for this one. Horsfall writes in an incredibly compressed style, making this book seem like a collection of notecards for a much longer book, but as long as you can parse his style, the material is logically organized and has tons of pointers to more extensive references, often in the footnotes on a sentence-by-sentence basis. Horsfall plows through the Aeneid in one hundred pages, trying to summarize centuries of debates in a handful of sentences. While his approach is quirky, it's also *very* informative. But beginners will find it overwhelming and probably annoying.Why Vergil? A Collection of Interpretationsis recommended as a *much* easier way into Virgil that focuses on the big themes."
0071446532,Event Planning Made Easy,"Summary 1: This is the best event planning book. It covers all aspects of event planning for gala charity balls etc. and special functions. I flicked through other event planning books and they were mostly about small events such as meetings and parties. This book is comprehensive in covering all aspects of big events.
Summary 2: Having consumed several books on the topic, this is an easy to read and useful book with good facts, lists, and questions to ask. It is not as detailed or as comprehensive as others available. Appendix A's sample forms, timelines and documents for planning and evaluating the event and Appendix B's lists of Terms and Phrases are very useful. I think it is good for someone who may wish to plan their own event, but not detailed enough for an individual who wants to become a professional in the industry. Event examples they use are from their professional experience and would not be applicable for one planning a private event. The pictures are in black and white and the detail is not clear. A few excellent color pictures would make a real difference.
Summary 3: This is illustrate the steps to organize a event, in a practical way. In this book, you cannot find the theory but the way.Pros: easy to read (even for beginners), step by step, straight forward, sufficient explaination, simple cases provided for learningCons: Seldom theory, not in-depth, bad paper quality
Summary 4: I have worked in the event industry for the last three years and decided to read through this book prior to getting into the industry. After gaining more experience and being apart of both small and large events I can honestly say that this book has a ton of applicable information. I highly recommend this book if you plan on entering the event industry, putting on your own event, or just would like to see how much time, effort, and planning goes into events.
Summary 5: I have bought several copies of this book and all my readers were very impressed with its clarity and interesting information. I would recommend it to anyone who is considering Entertainment and Conference Planning and even someone who needs to know how to plan for special occasions in their families. The authors are brilliant!"
B0007DQIOC,One is one,"Summary 1: This was read to me by both my 5th and 6th grade teachers and after the second time thru this misunderstood boy's trials and triumphs, I took my life-savings at the time (around $4) and bought the hardback for myself. Now, 35yrs later,a lifetime of reading (to excess) in my wake, I re-read it and still find it one of the best books I've ever known. Well, it's only about the little things in life.....childhood, fathers and sons, courage, death, friends, enemies, God, faith, and finding one's true heart and vocation in a brutal world...that's all. It's about Stephen, a sensitive artistic boy whose noble family think him a coward, who makes his way thru the monasteries, castles and battlefields of England in the Middle Ages,in search of himself. The adventures and vivid characters he encounters thrill and enrich us; the friends who light the way thru Stephen's journey and the tragedies that I wept to read thru led to a gloriously radiant end. The vocabulary may be a bit daunting, so encourage and help any young readers and if your child or class is reading this, act out the fight scene in the tavern. I remember my teacher sobbing thru several chapers, so keep a few Kleenex handy! This story of following your bliss and the authentic life still teaches me lessons I hope to share with the children around me. Bon Appetit!
Summary 2: One Is One is a fascinating and moving account, set in the Middle Ages, of a boy who does not fit in with his noble, warlike family and who has to come to terms with his ambition to be respected by his family and with his own gifts.
Summary 3: This was a beautiful book. I enjoyed reading about his journey. The author did an excellent job researching the time and in particular the ways of mixing plants to make colors for the illuminations."
0934633207,Teach Me More Japanese (Paperback and Audio Cassette): A Musical Journey Through the Year,"Summary 1: My son and I both love the CD and the variations between Japanese songs, bilingual songs that we knew prior, and conversations in Japanese. The book is a bit difficult to read because of the small print of the Japanese kanas, Romanji, and the English Translations in the back. This would be easily remedied with slightly larger print. It is still a great purchase.
Summary 2: We got this for our son who is 7, because he is an unschooler, and very motivated to learn Japanese. He and his younger brother (age 4) both love it. He plays it on repeat, brings it in the car, reads along, and checks the translations in the back. He has now memorized some songs and is getting the pronunciation down. Now they are asking for the Spanish version!
Summary 3: I found the product inadequate. This CD is a collection of children's songs, with some narrative, spoken by a child in Japanese, preceding each song. The weird thing is the narrative is completely unrelated to the song. Even my 9 year old figured out that the song following the child's narrative, was in her words ""completely random"".I don't know why the narrative wouldn't have a strong(er) relationship to the song. That aside, the songs chosen are perfect for very young children, under age 10. But there is no way you are going to ""learn"" Japanese by listening to this CD. The best result would be that you and a child would improve listening comprehension, which isn't a bad goal, but isn't how I interpreted the CD as advertised.
Summary 4: if you want to learn japanies this is great i thought myself and my kids japanies and now we just booked a trip to japan for this summer hopeing to learn more hope that you all have as much sucess as i did."

It is so well written, and, again, so well founded, that dismiss it was quite a task. Recently Dawkins wrote a book &quot;The blind Watchmaker&quot; that was inspired by Paley's &quot;Natural Theology&quot;, and solidly refutes his arguments (irrefutable in Paley's time, since no scientific evidence or theory had been powerfully establish as to do so).

This is a classic book, it is incredibly interesting from a lot of different perspectives, I highly recommend it.
Summary 7: I stumbled across this book quite by accident (or divine providence) and now it is one of my greatest treasures. Chapter One lays the foundation for Paley's argument for God's creation serving as the source of life and species. He poses two situations: if one stumbles upon a rock and questions its source, ""it has, perhaps, been there forever"" seems a rational answer; if one finds a watch laying on the ground, the explanation for the source of the rock seems to fail as an explantion for the source of the watch. The balance of the book is devoted to pointing out the fallacy of assuming that life could emanate from chance happenings. This book is a ""must read"" for Creation apologists, and it provides a challenging test to those who would rely on evolution as an explanation of the source of life. I would appreciate having any perceptions of flawed logic (by Paley) brought to my attention: jjkaufman@mac.com

Summary 14: William Paley's &quot;Natural Theology&quot; was written over two hundred years ago. But it is by no means an historical curiosity, for two reasons.The first is that no author, before or since, ever presented the Argument from Design in a fuller, clearer, or more persuasive form. The prose is elegant, the examples and arguments well crafted, the conclusions precisely stated, and all without either the pious condescension or angry threats typical of much religious apologetics. Paley engages the reader with his sympathetic tone, startling analogies, and shining sincerity.The second reason is that this is one of the most influential books ever written. Every subsequent writer on the Theory of Evolution, from Charles Darwin to Richard Dawkins, stands consciously in the shadow of this masterpiece. Read it yourselves, and find out why.

1568843925,Successful Presentations for Dummies,"Summary 1: This book is a comprehensive guide to the art and science of public speaking. It covers all the basics and then some. I am a professional speaker and a professional member of the National Speakers Association (www.nsaspeaker.com). I teach public speaking skills and always recommend this book. I totally disagree with a previous reviewer who says the way to better public speaking is through practice. Experience without foundation is not the best teacher where public speaking is concerned. There is much to be learned about presentation technique, content development, preparation, etc. The book also gives great tips for using humor to make your point, using audiovisuals appropriately (so many people use them inappropriately), handling questions and so much more. Whether experienced at speaking or a novice, everyone can glean something from this book.
Summary 2: I've had a copy of Successful Presentations for Dummies on my bookshelf since 1996 and found it to be a great reference and source of ideas for presentations as I have moved forward in my professional career. The book is broken up into various sections that address the most common problem areas for presenters and is easily referencable when you just need a quick review. I recommend this book, but it is now out of print.
Summary 3: As a professional speaker, I found this book full of useful information. The author covers everything from how to be introduced to how to end your presentation effectively. He tells you how to involve your audience, how to use humor, how to design your presentation, and more. It's full of tips and examples. While it's true that the best way to improve your public speaking is to just do it, this book will shorten your learning curve by years!"
1931160112,The Sperm Engine,"Summary 1: Ah - The Sperm Engine - Stephen Greco's debut success! This nasty little treasure, is a compilation of erotic journal entries, short fiction and narrative essays, with enough dirt for your inner voyeur to feast upon for weeks. After all, what else do you do with your inner voyeur? Offer to play a game of catch?Greco certainly is an acquired taste for those who prefer the memoir/essayist, David Sedaris. But for those for decide to take the risk, they will find that Greco is as witty and creative, if not a lot more risque. Alas, one shoud not catagorize this as plain erotica, though many of the chapters contain greatly detailed sex acts and thoughts. Greco tends to tell a greater story using erotica as a mere literary tool to help push his story along. His first chapter, gives an intense testimony to meeting his partner in the cruising grounds of a Brooklyn park and is handled very bluntly, where the reader mouth will drop open in pure shock and amusement. However other chapters confess darker tones, such as a story devoted to a character's last act of intimacy with his dying lover in a hospital bed. Greco explores more of the human frailty and conflict through sexuality. Not only does he share some of his most intimate secrets, but some of his wizdom as well.Of course, memoir and fiction certainly do interwine within this book and it can be difficult to distinguish which stories are fiction and which are not. One particular fiction piece, ""Men and their Issues"", follows the storyline of about 15-20 different characters over the course of one evening - some of the characters being humurously created and others more tragic.The ""Sperm Engine"" is a truely excellent read, blending in dramatic memoir, humour and erotica together. This may not be a book to read through in one sitting, but perhaps to be savored over several nights and reads.
Summary 2: I never thought I would get addicted to this book in the way that I did. As a hetero female, I assumed I wasn't the target audience. And I'm not. But that's besides the point. The stories are so engaging, so honest and funny that they transcend gay porn or erotic fiction. They're fascinating stories--a truly spectacular entree into the world of the penis.
Summary 3: This book is so boring that doctors should recommend it to those with insomnia because it'll put you right to sleep. Billed as an erotic book of essays, it did not succeed with its task.The author seems to dwell in his promiscuity, but bores us with stories about his furniture and odd stains on his upholstery instead of telling us how those stains got there.In another essay he tells of his dying lover in the hospital and the last time they performed together, then, at the funeral, his lover's nurse comes to tell him that he was &quot;with&quot; the lover several times--and the author thought that was comforting. Yet there were no details of any of these couplings.There is a point when trying to write erotica intelligently, which I am all for, that the writer inadvertantly eradicates all hints of passion and heat. The author completely leaves his readers cold and unmoved and still not in the mood, which is unfortunate. This book could have been very steamy and still maintained its dignity had the writer moved into the scenes and relived the physicality of his sessions. But no, we are to read about distant memories that have no feeling or touch attached.Instead of this book being labeled and marketed as erotica, it should have been listed as autobiographic...and if these are the highlights of a life, I feel sorry for the subject--how can one lead a life so boring?"
1566919207,Living Abroad in France,"Summary 1: This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon. This is a book published only last month (Oct. 2005). One of its most outstanding features for someone seriously considering relocation to La Belle France is what appears to be very recent and deailed information (in both Euros and dollars) calculated per square meter for the most part but it has tables for converting to feet) of what it takes to buy or rent in 5 different areas of France that are most popular with foreigners who have been coming to France to live in recent years in large numbers: Paris and its surroundings (Ile-de-France), Normandy and Brittany, Burgundy and the Rhone Valley, the Midi and Languedoc, and (last but not least) Provence and the Cote d'Azur. And he breaks down different towns and cities from the most high priced desirable areas to the least: e.g., in Bordeaux: ""Away from the river and in less expensive neighborhoods, the price drops. You can find apartments for 800-1800 Euros ($1080-2430) per square meter. etc.)"" This is really impressively detailed for all the areas he discusses and is highly useful information that might be hard to find anywhere else really. Of course, it will become outdated fast, but for latter 2005, this is great stuff to have.Link gives you some very sensible ideas for planning your fact finding trips, dealing with red tape in France (lots and lots) when you make your move, how to move with kids, pets, the kinds of insurance you need, job hunting, cost of living info, learning French, etc.--in short a very good summary of what it takes to move to this beautiful but (""complex--he didn't know about the riots of October and November 2005) from an American who has lived in the country for (I think) 13 years or so. Other books I have looked at of this kind seem to be written primarily for British expats and fairly youthful ones at that, not Americans, whereas as this one seems to be aimed at us Yanks as well (and the author is after all an American) and not just those who are sent by a corporation to work for a year or two. It's also good for somebody traveling to France and wanting some nice descriptive summaries of different regions of the country. The only thing lacking maybe is that it leaves out certain regions (perhaps for reasons of book size?) in the center of the country that might now be the best bargains. And while it does include a few thumbnail profiles of expats who have made the move, I would have welcomed a few more.Anyway, if this book is any indication, anyone considering retirement abroad (like me) would do well to invest in the Living Abroad series. I may buy the Italy volume next!
Summary 2: I have visited France many times but have never lived there for an extended period of time, but have recently thought about the possibility of relocating there. This book has provided me with a good overview, though probably outdated concerning cost now with the advantage of a stronger dollar. I enjoyed reading about someday being part of the French dedication to living and what would be expected of me as an expat. Concerning some of the red-tape discussed, for anyone seriously considering relocating, it would probably require more comprehensive information than this book offers. Informative and a good indication of what to expect, and for the adventurous it will have us packing.
Summary 3: Why the need for a specialized title on France when so many general travel books exist for the country? Because it's quite a different matter living in France as opposed to visiting it: there are concerns ranging from legalities and visas, work, and housing to cultural insights necessary to live alongside the French. In Living Abroad In France, author Terry Link begins with the dream and offers a step-by-step progression to achieving its reality, with chapters surveying all aspects of living in France. From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted.
Summary 4: Book was as described in perfect condition - buy from this seller with confidence."
1883011094,"Henry James: Complete Stories, 1892-1898 (Library of America)","Summary 1: Henry James (1843-1916) was nicknamed The Master by admiring fellow-authors towards the end of his life. He is truly a noble, gifted, psychological author depicting a by-gone era but including timeless insights about human beings and their general and mental situations in his writings. He is a master of lengthy prose (too lengthy for some!) These Library of America editions of James's writings are wonderful, high-quality, unabridged books with expert editing (notes) at the back of the volume. They have a knack for selecting the best editions of the author's writings where more than one version was published in the author's lifetime. The short stories of this volume are from the mature period but before James' final developed style of fictional writing. There are a large number of stories including many wonderful gems such as &quot;Owen Wingrave,&quot; &quot;The Coxon Fund&quot; and &quot;In the Cage.&quot; To be fair, most of the stories were written quickly for magazines, and a few (&quot;Glasses&quot; comes to mind) just aren't good stories at all, in my opinion. However, most of the stories do succeed quite well. &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; (criticized by Bernard Shaw as being too deterministic and neglecting free will) is actually a penetrating tale about military culture, military values, and the role of the military in the nineteenth-century world. &quot;The Coxon Fund&quot; is about a brilliant lecturer supported by the fund but whose life and the lives of his supporters are full of pitfalls outside of the Fund's influence. The story shows how the successes and failures of the Fund (and the Lecturer) have subtle and not-so-subtle ramifications for each of the characters. With &quot;In the Cage&quot;, the author steps outside of his accustomed higher-class and higher-educated mix of characters to present the plight of a penetrating lower-class telegram processor and her insights on life and her suitor. I found it a nice rendition of late-nineteenth century London. I encourage readers to explore this and other Library of America editions of James' writings.
Summary 2: During the 1890s, Henry James was a proper Englishman with special knowledge about the cousins on the other side of the water. Americans continue to crop up in the stories. So do ghosts. Several among the 21 stories in this volume 4 of LoA's edition of James stories have ghostly elements. HJ generally treads lightly in this field though, there is no cheap horror.'Nona Vincent' is a story about a play and a platonic triangle between the writer, his lead actress, and his benefactress. There is a mild ghost element, or is it a dream? Very much tongue in cheek.At the time of writing this story, HJ was himself trying to set foot on the stage as a playwright. He failed. He was not destined to be a stage star. Several of these stories are stagey.'The Real Thing': a painter tells us of a couple whose mission in life is looking good for photos and paintings. Too bad for the couple that they are not good at it. This story might be considered funny, but HJ doesn't normally do Schadenfreude.'The Private Life'. In a Swiss resort hotel a group of English tourists of the better sort meet 'by accident'. Funny, and a bit ghostly. We have a man who seems to exist in 2 permutations (the brilliant writer and the boring conversationalist) and another one who doesn't seem to exist at all, at times.'Lord Beaupre', a comedy about the marriage hunt. The scheming mother gets upended by her son and daughter.I find that HJ is at times entertaining even when he has nothing to say. One can still focus on the artful mischievous turn of the sentence.'Sir Dominik Ferrand', in the line of the earlier master piece The Aspern Papers, about the privacy rights of dead celebrities. Aspiring young writer buys used desk and finds 27 compromising letters written by a historic person. What to do with the treasure? HJ is a protector of privacy.'Collaboration', 'Owen Wingrave' , and 'The Wheel of Time' became a book together and I have reviewed it separately. An interesting but imperfect threesome.Similarly, 'The Middle Years' was packaged with 'The Death of the Lion', 'The Coxon Fund', and 'The Altar of the Dead' as 'Terminations'. I was less than enchanted with these stories, which are overcrowded and lack pace and simplicity.Then things look up again. The next 4 stories will be packaged together as 'Embarrassments' in 1896. They are fun. 'The Next Time' is a farcical tale around the question whether literary quality requires or maybe even guarantees lack of success. Quote: there are people who can't be vulgar for trying. Clearly about HJ himself.'Glasses' is a portrait of a pretty and naive young woman, a gold-digger.'The Figure in the Carpet' is a hoax of the kind found in the Aspern Papers.'The Way It Came' is a sophisticated and subtle ghost story. Or is it a story of insane jealousy? We will never know.Then comes the ghostly 'Turn of the Screw', a master piece of the genre. I have reviewed it separately.Followed by 'Covering End', a long story, a comedy about the old subject, Brits and Americans. It reads like a stage play and it takes an effort to get into. Machinations about ownership of an old mansion. Not convincing at all, ponderous language not matching the lightweight content.Finally 'In the Cage', another long story, about a woman who works in a telegraph office and who thinks about her customers' lives, based on the cables that cross her desk. Unusual for its working class setting, but not really convincing. Gissing would have done it better.In summary, while there are some pearls in this collection, the overall impression is a little disappointing.
Summary 3: Despite the objections that readers may raise as to style (difficult, convoluted) and his sometimes limited subject matter, Henry James remains one of the Great American writers, and also one of the most prolific. The mountain of fiction James created is truly impressive and almost consistently interesting. Library of America has dedicated multiple volumes to James, excluding only (as far as I am aware) his ""dramatic"" efforts, which were by and large a failure, if not a disaster. Consistent with its approach, LoA has published all of James's short stories in 5 volumes, organized by date of composition/publication. The present volume covers 1892-98, a fertile period for James's short fiction, encompassing the final years of his theatrical efforts and somewhat before his most difficult final period (i.e, The Golden Bowl, and others). This volume includes a number of stories that should be in ANY compilation of James's stories, including The Turn of the Screw, The Real Thing, The Figure in the Carpet, In the Cage, and others. It also is interesting to note that, at this point in his career, James's stories increasingly were concerned with loss, mortality, and ruminations on the ""legacy"" of an artist, for example ""Greville Fane,"" ""The Middle Years,"" ""The Death of the Lion,"" ""The Alter of the Dead,"" and "" The Figure in the Carpet."" The volume is done with LoA's usual quality and is certainly a worthy publication. My only reservations are these. First, if you are looking for a volume that includes the ""best"" of James's stories, you don't specifically care about this ""period,"" and you do not intend to collect or read all 5 LoA volumes of stories amounting to something like 4000 pages, you are probably better off with an anthology that covers all of James's writing career. Second, LoA has consistently followed a philosophy of letting the works speak for themselves, with little (if any) critical commentary or guidance, except for very good chronologies of the authors' lives. I certainly respect and understand this approach, and an interested reader can relatively easily acquire useful criticism or commentary from other sources. However, with James, perhaps more than some other LoA authors, some critical input would be quite valuable. For example, taking only The Turn of the Screw, the various interpretations are diverse and fascinating in their own right: is it a simple (relatively speaking) ghost story? Is the governess mentally unstable and the victim of repressed sexuality? It would go beyond the bounds of the LoA format fully to address these issues, but it might be useful if the volume at least gave the reader a ""heads up"" about the various interpretations and their sources.With those small reservations, this is a very good volume and a good place to start if you are deeply interested in James's shorter fiction. If anyone happened to pick up this volume, or read this comment, looking for a thesis or paper topic, for what it is worth, you could do worse than to think about James's short fiction on the artist, mortality and the artist's legacy and take special note of the stories cited above.
Summary 4: The short stories of Henry James are a microcosm of his novels: bafflingly complex, syntactically convoluted, and thematically multi-layered. He wrote more than 100 between 1864 and 1910, of which perhaps a few dozen are much read today. Complicating any discussion of his short prose is to define ""short."" Many of his short stories are long enough to qualify as novellas but regardless of the length, any fiction of Henry James promises to take the reader into the world of the microverse, a highly stylized and internalized arena where action counts less than thought and ""how"" far more than ""what."" For those who come to his short fiction after having read, say THE GOLDEN BOWL or THE AMBASSADORS, such readers have learned patience, secure in the knowledge that the inner workings of the mind are surely more interesting than the slam-bang world of reality.There are a few themes that James uses often both in his short and long fiction. He likes to place cultured and intelligent protagonists in an alien environment just to watch them squirm on a foreign alter, or what is more sinister, to maintain them in a familiar ground, only to change the laws of physics or rationality--and then watch them squirm. He employs the doppelganger, or double of the protagonist, one who might be his present or future version, or again more sinister, one who might be a spectral reincarnation. Many of James' heroes fear marriage and must battle an encrusted society that demands it. James was also fascinated with innocence, especially in children and child-like adults. In such stories, the world exists only to corrupt such innocence. Finally, James rarely used one theme in isolation. He much preferred to onion his stories with overlapping themes, all of which are centered on James' rich and allusive prose style, allowing him to meld the complexity of content with the complexity of style. I have chosen a few of his short prose fiction as examples of the quintessential Henry James.In ""The Aspern Papers,"" James writes of a narrator who must balance the need to obtain art (the papers of the deceased American poet Aspern) while maintaining his ethics while so doing. The narrator travels to Venice for these papers only to discover that their current owners are quite unwilling to give them up. He promises to marry one of them in return for their delivery to him, thinking all the while they are too nave to see through his scheme. In the end, he tries to steal them, only to learn that they have burned them, one page at a time. James' narrator is one of a long series of such who speak of integrity more than show it.In ""The Jolly Corner,"" James uses the ""double"" of the protagonist to point out how one man's life could have been had things been different. Spencer Brydon, an American expatriate returns to America, only to meet his ghostly alter ego, one who Brydon might have become had he stayed at home. Perhaps James had in mind Lambert Strether of THE AMBASSADORS, who is also the model of what the alter ego might have been: a money-grubbing capitalist with no one to tell him ""Live!""James uses ""The Pupil"" to depict the loss of childhood innocence. The caddish and grifting transplanted American Moreen family hires fellow American Pemberton to tutor their son. They refuse to pay him agreed on wages, all the while exhorting him with the nobility of his task. They offer him custody of their son, which he understandably refuses, but the boy is crushed since he favors Pemberton over his parents.Art versus life come into conflict in ""The Real Thing."" The narrator is hired by a couple, punningly named the Monarchs, to paint them as exemplars of the ""real thing"" of nobility. It is his realization that the reality of their claim does not allow him to create the illusion of a second-rate knock off. He is unwilling to further society's need to measure a life by glorifying its phony aspect.In these stories and in Henry James' others, he presents the reader with a subjective examination of the inner workings of the mind. For those readers who wish to enter such a microverse, they will find that James' admittedly baffling style will be seen as more as a part of that journey than an impediment.
Summary 5: Why is Amazon listing this book, Henry James: Complete Stories 1892-98 as available new? I ordered it in February and never received it. Amazon notified me frequently of continuing delays and, then, a few weeks ago cancelled the order, the book being unavailable. This is one of two volumes of James's stories which Amazon lists but has been unable to provide. I've written the same review for the other one.I have since ordered a used copy and received it without delay!The stories, of course, all five volumes are perfection, delight, wondrous! The edition is beautiful: print is very small and on thin paper but still easy to read. The hardback bindings hold the pages together securely yet allow the reader to hold the book open without a lot of effort. The little ribbon marker is a nice touch."
0618030239,Louie's Goose,"Summary 1: This book is a great story for any children who are attached to a stuffed animal, blanket, etc.
Summary 2: my 2 year old daughter is always excited about how mum & dad & the sun fix Louies`s goose, cute story & pct.
Summary 3: A good childrens' book, excellent for reading to pre-school aged children. The text can easily be understood by the 3 and 4 year olds in my library story hour as they identify with Louie and his most favorite stuffed animal, a red goose. The illustrations are great!"
B00088QH4W,The epigrams of Martial (Bohn's classical library),"Summary 1: Martial, like many of the Latin poets, was born in Bibilis, Spain, probably around 38-41 AD. He appears to have lived in Rome for nearly thirty-four years, under the patronage of the great Spaniard Senaca the Younger. He belonged to a class of intellectuals who were in resolute opposition to the emperor Domitian, so many times figures like Cicero, Brutus, and Pompey are used as literary devices against the crazed tyrant. Martial's poems are definitely modeled off of Catullus' epigrams and elegiac verses, although they are different in meaning and theme. These poems are hilarious and audacious, cruel, lewd, charming, spiteful, and creative; and they bring to life the social and political milieu of Rome. Martial's poems make for great bedtime reading and they are at their best when read in small doses. Michie's Anglo-cized translation, with a parallel Latin text, is good, however the rhyming couplet certainly does Martial's epigrams a grave injustice. The poems are excellent, although another translation is recommended; but another one will be hard to find which remains faithful to the original. The Loeb editions are always great, but the translators nearly always kill the original poetic song with dry early-twentieth-century prose.
Summary 2: This book is a pleasant and often amusing read, a nice mix of day to day observations, occasional spice, certainly cheap at twice the price.
Summary 3: Firstly, let me say that I am not an expert in Latin, though I am certaintly able to read it, understand it, and also know a little about its literary techniques. One of the most grating errors I have found in this translation is the continual rhyming of its lines. Latin, being a language of often mutable word ending but even more amorphous word order, had no need to rhyme its verse, and therefore any translation, in English, that insists on rhyming for any purpose usually obfuscates the original meaning so much that it is, in of itself, a whole different poem.I have also seen the ommission of many names in the work, which I find unappealing. While I do enjoy that it is able to combine the original latin with the english translation, I would recommend searching for a similar book with a better translator: it will make the epigrams far more enjoyable.
Summary 4: This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like ""terra"" into configurations like ""turf and dew,"" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple ""earth."" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."
0323014283,Current Surgical Therapy,"Summary 1: If you only have time to read one book, this is the one. Every topic is boiled down to only the pure gold. All the useless facts that you can't remember anyway are left out. Presented in an easy to understand, easy to remember format. This is really all you need. I plan on reading every new issue when available. By the way, I've read Schwartz, Norton, Sabiston, and ACS over the past few years. All are good, but I already work long enough hours for my free time to be spent reading such lengthy texts.
Summary 2: Excellent text overall and in details. Very helpful in everyday practice and in Board preparation.
Summary 3: This is an easy to read surgery text with up to date techniques and tests; however, there are numerous errors in the text. For the most part they are simple ones, easily reasoned out (i.e. gastric pH decreased with PPIs); but, for a seventh edition this kind of sloppiness calls into question the integrity of rest of the text."
0393050742,Still Love in Strange Places: A Memoir,"Summary 1: This was the most surprising and beautiful book I have read this year. It is a poem, a watercolor, a dream half-remembered upon waking, a world rebuilt. You will be swept away, and it will stay in your heart for a long time.In stunning words, Beth Kephart writes of a coffee farm where her husband grew up in the jungled hills of El Salvador. It is a farm inhabited by souls living, mythical and dead: here among the dusty roads, crowded graveyards, and lush coffee plantations we meet ghosts of 11th century Indians, Siguanaba (the witch who haunts the doomed) and especially Don Alberto, her husband's beloved and legendary grandfather, who founded the coffee farm and died there &quot;anchored into the hands of those he loved and into the memories of others.&quot;This book is a testament to memory, and to the endurance of our deeds. It is a book about a beautiful and fecund land lacerated by earthquakes, snipers, and greed. It is a dramatic book by a brave woman about an exotic place, but it is a book that speaks to all of us about what holds the world together: memory, family, courage, love. Read it, and give it to the people who matter most to you. This is a brilliant work.
Summary 2: The way I see this evocative and quite heroic book is this: This is a beautiful journey not only to another place, but it's a story, really about a brave, sensitive, shy writer, who happens to be an impassioned mother and wife who is trying to figure out how to understand her (the) new American Family, of which she is a wonderful chronicler. This is an epic adventure, really, but not just to an exotic place but deep inside of what it means to be in a family in America in 2002. The very idea of family is radically different than just a few years ago. Kephardt had a longer way to go than most of us to understand where she fit in, where her family came from, and how she could cope with and understand it. What an admirable trip and what a lucky family to have her.This book is quite relevant to anybody who loves anybody and is frightened of their enormous responsibilities therein. It's a monument ot the bravery of those rare spouses, moms, sisters who just won't ever quit on the people they love. The fact that it's beautifully written, and very evocative is a huge bonus. She is bright, funny, and unsparingly honest about herself. This is a big, rare and great work. Honest.
Summary 3: A beautiful book and well-written. It is for the type of reader who enjoys getting into the hearts and minds of both the writer and the people about whom he or she is writing. Books such as this require the reader to think--Kephart does a great job bringing her readers with her. Also, Ms Montgomery (see her review) also does a great job in communicating the essence of Kephart's book--but then Montgomery is a great writer too!!
Summary 4: Beth Kephart's Still Love In Strange Places is a poignant, loving tale of her learning to love the people, the land and the country she married into-El Salvador. It puts this extraordinary place, with a painfully sad history and a future that speaks or reemergence in a much bigger, more poetic context. I felt for her and the real people she brought to life. Makes you want to come here as I have just done. Mark Monchek
Summary 5: A memoir of a woman's attempt to understand the history and culture that shaped her El Salvadorian husband. She wants to make herself part of his early life and to be able to pass this culture on to their son. While she provides a good basic introduction to El Salvador, including history, the economy, and geology, her search for understanding seems half-hearted. As an engaging portrait of her life or of the people of El Salvador, it's disappointing. However, there is not a lot of information out there on this country, so those planning to travel there might find some of the descriptions interesting."
0785273433,"The Lies We Tell Ourselves Overcome Lies And Experience The Emotional Health, Intimate Relationships, And Spiritual Fulfillment You've Been Seeking","Summary 1: This is the SAME book as The Lies We Believe. I ordered both books with the belief that they were different. Upon reciept of both books, I found out that they are identical in content. Only the titles and the covers are different. I could have saved myself some money if the descriptions had mentioned that the content was identical.
Summary 2: Many books that address human need are a little helpful, or apply a little bit. This book by Dr. Thurman is exceptional in its scope of usefulness. It is very easy to read and straight forward with its insights, one does not have to guess the conclusion that the author wishes you to find. Each point is illustrated with a story from the doctors practice. This is very helpful is seeing how to apply that chapter.The book is soothing to the soul of those with a damaged heart. It is also a wonderful resource for those wishing to be helpful to others with a damaged heart.Many thanks to the good doctor,
Summary 3: Thurman does an excellent job of providing Biblical responses to dysfunctional thoughts. Christian practioners who practice Christian forms of Rational Emotive Therapy or Cognitive Therapy will find this book useful. His list of ten Biblical truths provides great Biblical resources for developing healthy/biblical schemas
Summary 4: Dr. Thurman provides an excellent resource for Christian Counselors who practice from a Rational Emotive or Cogntive Therapy perspective. He provides sound, biblical responses to distorted thinking. His ten biblical truths provide an excellent resource for dealing with dysfunctional schemas.
Summary 5: I read this book several years ago and after having a rather indepth conversation with a friend decided I wanted to purchase a copy as a gift for them. I had some trouble finding a new or like new copy since it is out of print but it was worth the hunt. I loved the book when I read it and refer back to it frequently. The friend I sent this copy to says they are addicted to it. We are both sorry that this book is no longer in print as it makes it difficult to share with others that might also really enjoy it. Neither one of us is willing to pass our copy on for fear of not getting it back. It would have to be a very good friend."
0915463385,ONE EYED DREAM,"Summary 1: This book arrived looking just as nice as a brand new one, even though it was listed as, ""Used."" Very pleased and would highly recommend this seller!
Summary 2: i believe he depicts the old west just as it was. he mixes fiction with fact brilliantly. love titus bass stories and also custer stories. you can see how the indians really got a raw deal. you really get a feel for those times.
Summary 3: Terry C Johnston has done a great job on the Titus Bass series. Very period detail correct. He makes you feel like your in the mountains riding along with Ol' Scratch and Josh."
0931674182,The Mark of the Maker,"Summary 1: This beautiful version of the Christmas story is lovingly told from Joseph's perspective. It allows you to begin to understand the terrible fear and apprehension he must have felt knowing that Mary, the woman he loved, was pregnant by the grace of God. It also explores the father/child relationship on several levels. This book is filled with grace, love, and genuine heart. Enjoy the peace that it can bring to your world...
Summary 2: Mr Hegg has obviously had differences with his own father sometime in the past. He has imagined a story about a young man's dilemma's growing up and tied it in beautifully with the Christmas story. Every American male should read this book or have it read to him. Then take 2 or 3 days to think it over and see if he can relate. It can remove any doubts about his own worth and about the worth of doing a job right. Maybe I'm reading too much into a juvenile story but I got the message that there's a deeper mature meaning to the last passage in the book. And Tom had the astuteness to leave it open to the readers interpretation. I absolutely loved the book.
Summary 3: Tom Hegg and Warren Hanson have, over the years, given their fans some wonderful and memorable books. The Mark of the Maker is no exception.Hegg tells the biblical story of Joseph as the apprentice carpenter. The lessons from his father are not understood at first. It's only as Joseph matures, learns his craft and is then given the remarkable experience of becoming the earthly father of Jesus, that the lessons finally make sense. As Joseph gazes at the manger that holds the Christ child, it all becomes clear.The Mark of the Maker is an inspirational version of Joseph's story. The sepia illustrations are beautiful and add an important dimension.Armchair Interviews says: The Mark of the Maker is a wonderful gift book for any time of the year. But with the Christmas season approaching, it is a poignant reminder of what came before Jesus' birth.
Summary 4: This is a fantastic story of the manner in which Mary and Joseph grew up and met, an account that we don't hear very often. I highly recommend it as an important part of the Christmas Story.
Summary 5: The write-up was not good. This is definitely a children's book(?) Very disappointed."
184352080X,Talk Now! Tagalog (French Edition),"Summary 1: This CD is &quot;fast, fun &amp; user friendly&quot; just like the good people at Talk Now say. It plays on both Windows and Mac computers. I recommend it for what it is. A beginner's learning tool for the essential words and phases. A useful feature is you can learn using YOUR native language as you have choice of over 70 languages. I tried Chinese as I know it reasonably well and it worked just OK - I feel they designed it primarily for those with English as their 1st language. So if you American, Brit, Aussie, or Canadian this is a good beginner's guide for you.It's best feature is it's pronounces the words in both male and female voices as many Tagalog courses do not pronounce the words for you :-( You will enjoy the games and tests to measure your progress and it allows you to print your own dictionary for handy reference. I just wish it covered even more of our Tagalog words. Just incase I forget them.hehehe
Summary 2: Nice interactive cd for beginning Tagalog. Learn basics such as numbers, colors, directions as well as some simple dialogs. The sound is quite clear and allows you to hear the words pronounced alternately by a male and a female voice. There are also multiple choice quizes that test what you have learned. There is a text that can be printed as well to assist in the learning of Tagalog.
Summary 3: Teaches a working vocabulary. Games provided are based on repeating the words so it does imprint the words. However, they do not provide any basics as to how to put words together to create sentences. It's still OK though as it does claim to be appropriate for ""absolute beginners"".
Summary 4: If you are looking to buy this software in order to speak to someone back and forth, this is not the product for you. It will teach you phrases and questions, but you won't be able to understand any answers that a native speaker might give you because it doesn't teach you that. You will be able to identify objects in a house or building, but you won't know how to use them in a sentence or even in a fragmented sentence. This is also true for colors. If this is what you rely on to travel somewhere you might find yourself in the middle of a croud just saying azul(blue)......pula(red).... malalim na azul(dark blue)....Nasaan ang maipaparada ng kotse(where can I park the car?) and then even when you ask where can I park the car you won't know where to park it because you won't understand anything that people will tell you because it doesn't teach you that(people might think you're retarded haha). It only teaches you numbers up to 20, so you're out of luck if you ask magkano ito? (how much is this?) and the answer is 150 pisos. You'll just have to hand a merchant a wad of cash and hope he is honest and gives you your change. However, with all the bad things out of the way, this might make a good start for you to learn how to say the words correctly, even though the guy that talk doesn't pronounce the words correctly on there, just click on the girl(she says the correct pronunciations). After completing the CD, Which only took a bout a week and a day and scoring a perfect score on everything on the CD,I would say that this software is incomplete. The manufacturer could have done a better job. I give it a 1 out of 5."
0521531063,Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary PB with CD-ROM,"Summary 1: I consider the CD-Rom you get with the book the best dictionary on the market. Each entry has IPA symbols and also a red loudspeaker icon for the British pronunciation and a blue one for the American. A microphone icon lets you practise your pronunciation.The feature I like using every day is the QUICKfind with the automatic sound. You just point the mouse at a Word document or at the text on a web page and the software speaks up the sound for you. While listening to the sound, the QUICKfind let you have a small dictionary window open on the screen with the meaning of each word you are pointing the mouse at, and the two loudspeakers with both English and American pronunciations are still there. Just imagine all those foreign languages and literatures university students who are going to prepare for their oral exams and have to be able to read aloud loads of poems with a perfect pronunciation and also explain the words' meanings - what a lot of time saved with the aid of this software!The main window has three other useful icons, i.e. Exercises, Pictures and Study pages.Among the Exercises, you can find Word Exercises (adjectives and adverbs, affixes, homophones, irregular and problem verbs, noun forms, suffixes, verbs meaning 'perform') and Pictures Exercises (animals, back, birds, body, car exterior, car interior, cars and trucks, clothes, flowers, foot, fruit, hair, hand, hats, head, in the kitchen, in the office, kitchen equipment, office equipment, phrasal verbs, planes, ships and boats, skeleton, sports, vegetables).Among the Pictures you can find about 100 tables of content with colourful drawings. If you point the mouse at a drawing, its word appears, whereas if you click on the drawing, its meaning appears.Among the Study pages you can find very useful documents in PDF format, divided into two categories, i.e. ""Vocabulary, Grammar, Pronunciation"" (a guide to pronunciation, determiners, homographs, homophones, irregular verbs, modal verbs, phrasal verbs, prefixes and suffixes, punctuation, regular inflections, regular verb tenses, relative clauses, word building) and ""General Information"" (common names, common symbols, computers, geographical names, letter writing, measurements and quantities, money, periods of time, relationships, sounds and smells, telephoning, varieties of English, work and jobs).I would give this item six stars, if only I could! Highly recommended to all those who need a very fast desktop companion, for it's a real pleasure to work with, and once the software is saved into your hard disk, you won't need to run the CD any more.
Summary 2: For non-native speakers this is a God send, the CD provides both British and American pronunciation and I consider this is the most useful feature for this dictionary.Once you installed the CD to your hard drive in full installation mode, then store your CD in a safe place because you don't need it anymore.I highly recommend this to anyone who have a hard time to find how to pronoun the English words.
Summary 3: To catch a real pronunciation of words, I often use Collins Cobuild English Dictionary CD-ROM, Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary CD-ROM, and occasionally Merriam-Webster's free on-line dictionary .... In most cases, the pronunciation of Merriam-Webster is most euphonic. And from a comparison with Cambridge Dictionary CD-ROM, it can be roughly infered that Merriam-Webster has an Briticism, and the tones in Collins Cobuild CD-ROM tend to be American (but seem a bit monotonous).However, Collins Cobuild CD-ROM supplements a shortage of Cambridge Dictionary CD-ROM in thesaurus part (Cambridge Dictionary CD-ROM offers only related words, not synonyms). Furthermore, Collins Cobuild CD-ROM offers a lot of real sentences and examples to help reader define a word more accurately. This is exactly why I choose Collins Cobuild English Dictionary for Advanced Learners rather than a reputed Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary or Random House Webster's College Dictionary. By the way, both Webster's Unabridged Dictionaries have CD-ROM versions. If any opportunity, I'd like to try to explore any one of them."
1568843933,Investing for Dummies,"Summary 1: I found the book to be quite helpful, however, there were some details he missed. Also, one concern I had was the overwhelming push toward Vanguard. I appreciate his enthusiasm for Vanguard, but when I contacted Vanguard to setup an account, their customer service was so delayed, unresponsive and disinterested that I chose not to do business with them. I found that a shock considering how much Tyson raves about Vanguard.

Even though they've managed to survive and grow (albiet slowly) over the past 30 years (as opposed to the late Reform Party) and they've also managed to show a consistent strength without resorting to continually renominating the same celebrity candidate (as opposed to the Greens), many political commentators tend to dismiss America's largest third party as &quot;a bunch of Republicans who want to get stoned.&quot; The fact of the matter is that, even as the Libertarians have been ridiculed, many of their ideas have been adopted into the so-called political &quot;mainstream.&quot; Even their most controversial stand -- the legalization of drugs -- has become more and more acceptable with each passing year. And, compared to most other third party candidates, the Libertarians have been able to consitently nominate credible candidates for the office of presidency -- such as Ron Paul in 1988 and especially Ed Clark in 1980. Polling over a million votes, Clark was by far the Libertarians most succesful presidential candidate and his campaign is reponsible for bringing several previously frustrated voters into his party's camp. Clark wrote a New Beginning specifically for the 1980 campaign and, despite being twenty years old, it remains a valuable introduction to the beliefs and philosophy behind the Libertarian Party. Writing in clear, level-headed prose, Clark explains why the Libertarians believe that government has become too intrusive in American life, why the War on Drugs is a waste of taxpayer money that does more harm than good, and -- perhaps most importantly -- demolishes the myth that the Libertarians are a bunch of a anti-government flakes. Instead, Clark details policies that, if radical, also tend to make a lot more sense than the bloated government gridlock perpatrated by the mainstream political establishment over the past few decades. While I don't agree with the entire platform (in specific, the isolationist bent of some Libertarians tends to leave me a bit alienated), its still a well-written polemic that deserves every voter's consideration.
Summary 2: I read this in '80, and voted for Clark. I long ago lost the book, but recently bought it again. His same arguments apply today, but when he made them, they would have been effective and the required adjustments would not have been as severe and sudden as they are going to by necessity be today.Standing back and comparing today with America 50 years ago is informative; Clarks' book came out midway in that run, as an early reaction to what he saw coming.JFK's federal spending in early 60's was $100B, over half of which was for defense at the peak of the Cold War. That was an America with a population that was about half of ours today, maybe more, but let's call it half to be generous.We can inflation adjust JFK's spending by x 7.5, and population adjust by x 2.0 to get to $1500B/yr in federal spending. We are at $3800B/yr in federal debt fueled spending. That is 243% of JFK's fully adjusted number. Is that a fair adjustment? And then some. It assumes, for instance, that the population was half, and yet it was more like 180M. We are at 330M, so that adjustment should only be 1.83. As well, it assumes zero (0) increase in the efficiency of government. IOW, the art of governance has not advanced in 50 years of technology, such that it costs just as much per capita to 'govern' today as it did in JFK's early 60s, still waiting as it was for the 029 punchcard machine to show up.If JFK's defense budget grew by that same generous factor of 15, it would be $780B today. But the GOP was just chastised for increasing the Obama Administrations defense budget request from 70% of JFK's fully adjusted number to 71% of JFK's fully adjusted number. Well of course; we are no longer in the middle of the Cold War, it should be smaller. But ask yourself; if defense is at 71% of JFK's fully adjusted number, then why is total federal spending at 253% of JFK's fully adjusted number? (Remember, in current dollars, it is really at 3800% of JFK's spending. Population: 1.83:1 public spending: 38:1)If there was anything as a positive 'multiplier effect' on public debt fueled public spending, then our current $2.3T/yr 'stimulus' over and above JFK's $1500B/yr 'stimulus' should have American economies on a tear relative to JFK's America. You know, the America that was building the Interstates and going to the Moon and addressing old civil rights wrongs and educating a generation of young Americans who left the best schools in the world with hope and optimism for the future. That America, the one with the $100BH in federal spending, over half of which was for defense at the peak of the Cold War.Go ask a 2012 graduate about hope and optimism for the future with our $3800B/yr in federal spending. With some justice, more than half of them will tell you that their hope lies in expanding government, because we've raised generations of instructed idiots who leave their schooling fully 'socialized.' One thing they should have learned, however, is to count. As in, count the number of cabinet post departments in JFK's administration, and count the number 50 years later. Then, go find the plain to see federal spending numbers I just outlined.50 years is enough time to gauge the efficacy of America's experiment in centrally planned command and control 'the economy' running. It turns out, we are no better at it than the Soviet Union, for exactly the same reason; it doesn't work.Our affliction is obvious, and we are in denial.
Summary 3: Ed Clark (born 1930) ran for Governor of California in 1978 (receiving more than 5% of the votes), and for President as the nominee of the Libertarian Party in the 1980 election. (He received 1.06% of the total popular vote, which is the highest a Libertarian Party candidate has ever received in a presidential race.)This was his ""campaign book"" for 1980, and makes an effective introduction to Libertarianism, with chapters such as Cutting Government Down to Size; The Inflation Hoax; Non-Intervention: The Key to Peace; Social Security: The Ultimate Pyramid Scheme, etc.He proposes to cut out ""boondoggles"" such as the Energy Security Trust Fund (pg. 14); eliminate the Department of Energy (pg. 15); and freeze the number and compensation of federal employees (pg. 18).After summarizing USA/CIA interventions in Iran, he says, ""Despite this record of insolent intervention in Iranian affairs... (President Carter) claims he's at a complete loss to explain such hostility"" as the mobs chanting, ""Death to the United States!"" (Pg. 36)He states that as President, he would work bo abolish both subsidies AND regulations of the nuclear power industry; ""utilities will be liable for any damage to life and property resulting from the conduct of their business and the disposal of spent fuel."" (Pg. 57)Concerning Social Security, he argues that ""We should fund Social Security out of general revenues... and by cutting federal spending in other areas, we can avoid any tax increase."" (Pg. 81)This is an excellent brief statement of Libertarian principles."
1580532969,"Software Verification and Validation for Practitioners and Managers, Second Edition","Summary 1: Bill Gates is famous for his yearly retreats where he takesa pile of books and reads them. Maybe that's the one thingtoday's managers should emulate. If you do, bring this bookalong on your first sabatical.This all new edition of the book (first published in 1997)was even renamed to include its new, extended charter.&quot;Clearly management must take a leadership role in helpingthe organization behave in a more predictable way. It isfor this reason that the title of the book has been changedto include managers. [the book] includes specific actionsthat managers can take to help organizations behave in amore predictable manner.&quot;Software development is a difficult disciple to master.Even so, technical acumen is no guarantee of quality. &quot;Asobserved by Dr. Edwards Deming, 'The quality of a productis directly related to the quality of the process used tocreate it.'&quot; Verification (&quot;are we building the productright?&quot;) and validation (&quot;are we building the right product?&quot;)are the first questions one must ask to begin the pathof process improvement. This book addresses those questionsand more.The book is divided into four large sections. The firstthree sections are brought forward from the previousedition with some noticeable improvements. The new editionis not just a rehash of the old stuff, however. Over 30 newpages of appendices and an entire new section of the bookaimed at management with over 70 new pages have been added.Other improvements are also evident including better formatting.For example, the font selection and layout are much easier onthe eyes than in the previous edition.If you own the first edition, this is a &quot;must have&quot; update.If you don't own the first edition, consider this work anSQA department &quot;starter kit.&quot; It is well organized, wellannotated, and filled with practical artifacts such aschecklists for inspections, suggested document outlines,and the like. This is stuff you can use.Chapter 12 is specifically for the CEO and should berequired reading by anyone running a company with asoftware development function. &quot;Managers and executivesneed to understand that having a predictable softwaredevelopment process is vitally important to the long-termsuccess of their business.&quot; Rakitin shows how, then showswhat can be done. The prose is crisp and to-the-point.Well done.
Summary 2: This book is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste authors writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. It never should be used for computer science students (unless the instructor himself has no clue about the subject). This book is for people with no formal training who want to learn some random buzzwords.
Summary 3: The book was godd, but like alll the Validation/Verification books on the market... it never hits the points that are really needed to make 'your' process successful.Although I did think that overall it is a good guide.
Summary 4: Este es un libro eminentemente pr&aacute;ctico sobre ""Ingenier&iacute;a del Software"".A diferencia de otros libros, excesivamente llenos de ejemplos (normalmente de las malas pr&aacute;cticas), &eacute;ste se centra en describir las diferentes aproximaciones para todas las etapas de desarrollo del software. Aunque se decanta por el modelo de desarrollo ""Waterfall"", explica otros modelos de desarrollo.Un elemento a destacar de este libro es la calidad de los ap&eacute;ndices que incluyen numerosas plantillas de ejemplo para cada una de las etapas de desarrollo, y en especial para los procesos de inspecci&oacute;n, y seguimiento de los errores.Otro aspectos que se cubren &eacute;xito en este libro son los dedicados a la estimaci&oacute;n de esfuerzos para la planificaci&oacute;n, estimaci&oacute;n de riesgo que en casi ning&uacute;n libro de ingenier&iacute;a del software ofrece alternativas tan interesantes como en este.A modo de ejemplo, los ap&eacute;ndices que incluye son los siguientes:- Inspection Roles and Responsibilities- A Sample Inspection Process- Inspection Process Forms- Inspection Checklist- Attributes of Good Requirements Specifications- Sample Criteria for Selecting Modules for Code Inspection- Sample Software Development Process Based on the Waterfall Model.- Document Outlines- Test Cases for the Triangle Program (example)- Software Reliability Models.- The Yellow Sticky Method- Software Development Best Practices- Software Quality Best Practices- Project Postmortems- Root-Cause AnalysisFinalmente el autor mantiene una p&aacute;gina Web asociada al libro: http://www.swqual.com/index.html?Intro.Especialmente interesantes es la newsletter mensual.Carlos Ortega2006-01-30"
0152012931,The Glass House People,"Summary 1: it wasn't a waste of time, either. It's about a 16 year old girl named Beth who is forced to go along with her mother to her mother's childhood home. Hanny Lynn, Beth's mother, ran away from her family when she was a teenager and hasn't had contact with them since, and for a good reason! But what secret is hiding under the surface of this family? And why does Aunt Iris hate Hanny Lynn so much?It was a little disappointing. I was expecting so much more from this book, but I do have to say the characterization was strong. I liked the contrasting personalities - especially that of drunken Aunt Iris. And the whole glass concept woven into the book was interesting as well. All in all, I'd probably give it a B.
Summary 2: I just finished reading this book. It was awesome, and I couldn't put it down! The characters were very realistic, and I could picture everything. The plot was great. It was full of suspense. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes mysteries. Here's my summary: Hannah, who left her family 20 years ago, has decided to come back home. She and her family re-encounter the tragedy that happened so many years ago. Can they finally work out their problems after such a long time trying to ignore it?
Summary 3: I don't know what it is about Reiss that I found so appealing when I was younger, but that appeal level has gone significantly down. I still do find some of her books to be positively fascinating, but really? She calls this a book? It begins slow and continues to be slow throughout the sequence of events. In comparison to Reiss's more supernatural books, this is a complete bore. It contains an obnoxiously simple and linear plot in which pretty much nothing happens. The entire book continues to basically be a broken record, with no real resolution, twists, anything much. It's unnecessarily melodramatic, and at multiple times I found myself uncontrollably laughing at the absurdity of it all, especially at what were supposed to be the more tense parts. The only well-developed truly round character in the story is Grandad, and he doesn't play much of a role at all until the unsatisfying end. This is not a book worth your time. I love her supernatural ones, but this really was nothing special.Rating: 1.5/5
Summary 4: When I first purchased this book I expected a very thrilling, exciting mystery but when I finished reading it, it seemed as a somewhat boring novel because the story and events felt repetitive. That each event was just like the other. However I must say, the story did make me read on and on, for about 2 hours once. The story was quite a weird one...A young girl named Beth and her single mother, Hannah, and younger brother, Tom, drove to the east coast from California to visit their grandparents' home. It was uncomfortable for Beth and Tom however even more for Hannah because she ran away from her parents' home and never returned for 20 years. Once they arrived, the layout of the house was the same, however the people weren't. Throughout their whole stay, many quarrels between Hannah and her drunken sister, Iris, had erupted about the cause of death of Clifton Becker. It was a blessing for Beth and Tom to ever get out of the house and hang out with some neighbors around. The whole stay, Beth and Tom tried to figure out the story behind Clifton and how to solve the 20 year old mystery. After all these years, someone finally admitted who pushed him down the deadly stairs, but who was it really?"
1902405110,Moment of Astrology,"Summary 1: `The Moment of Astrology' takes a thorough look at astrology through examining the arguments against, and attacks on astrology by various people and groups over hundreds of years. These relate particularly to the arguments of St Augustine from more than fifteen hundred years ago, Pico della Mirandola from more than five hundred years ago, and more recently of 186 scientists in 1975.Geoffrey Cornelius is a consultant astrologer with a background in philosophy and divination and has been active in UK astrological education since the 1970s. The author is a past President of the both Astrological Lodge of the Theosophical Society and the Astrological Lodge of London, as well as a former editor of the quarterly journal `Astrology'. He co-founded the Company of Astrologers in 1983.I haven't read a lot of these types of books so was a bit worried that the language would be too technical or hard to understand - I was pleasantly surprised to find the language used was very easy to understand and flowed well. The style of writing was very smooth. Obviously you do have to have a good understanding of astrological theory and principles to understand the arguments in `The Moment of Astrology'.Some of the techniques explored include horary, katarche and an exploration of the use of symbol in the astrological chart. Cornelius also spends a couple of chapters exploring science and symbol - I found these fascinating and would recommend that anybody involved in astrology should read at least these two chapters. A thorough examination of the relationship between astrology and science is given, with exploration of various scientific experiments that have been held over the years (including the New York Suicide Study, the Vernon Clark Experiments, and also a look at Jung in relation to astrology. The Appendix is excellent and well worth reading to get full benefit of some of the arguments presented in this title.This book gave me much more than I expected so I recommend `The Moment of Astrology' to the reader who has a thorough understanding of astrological principles, who perhaps feels that there is something lacking in their technique, or for those that are looking for a different way to understand this complex subject.
Summary 2: This book is a work of genius, whether or not you believe or completely disbelieve astrology. I personally don't believe in it(yet). In fact, as a serious amateur astronomer, I know a lot about the stars, and have long focused on the science of stellar evolution and cosmology. But that has never eliminated a fascination with the historical richness of the ideas and symbolism of astrology, and I have always had a fondness for the period when astronomers and astrologers were one--literally, as in Kepler and Brahe. In fact, I have always felt that Science was just one way of looking at the world--a good way, but not the only way, and just a full of its own biases as any other perspective. In this book, Cornelius combines what is clearly a profoundly learned and creative grasp of astrology's history with a fluid literary skill that makes complex ideas and comparisons read like poetry. Never content with superficial analysis, he delves into what I (as a relative beginner) would call Deep Esoterica, and makes it fun and illuminating; witness for example his explication of the Greek word, katarche, and its evolution through many centuries of use and misuse by astrologers, just one example of thousands in this book of analyses that are always clearly connected to a strong evaluation of past and current astrology. This is his strongest point...whatever topic he choses is always focused on a higher purpose, a larger argument that keeps these complicated issues buzzing along. Any lesser talent would overwhelm the reader with details and drive them to the simplistic trivia of modern astrology. But the clarity and originality of his ideas keeps us motivated and on target. For non-astrologers, don,t let the few horoscope analyses in the early chapters discourage you from reading on; while these are beyond the beginner, most of the major points he makes are understandable by anyone interested in philosophy and culture, and bring a refreshing insight into the underpinnings of this ancient art/religion/science/divination.
Summary 3: I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I only read this book quite recently on the recommendation of a friend. The book has been around since the mid-90s. In my defense I had gotten interested in horary astrology in the 80s and spent a decade reading everything I could find and doing hundreds and hundreds of charts. In the late 80s I wrote my first book on horary (published in 1991 and now out of print). It was subtitled ""Horary Astrology: The History and Practice of Astro-Divination."" This subtitle is significant because in reading Cornelius' book, I realized that he had read the same sources and come to very similar conclusions as my own. Maybe that's why I like his book so much. By the time Cornelius' published his text, I was feeling saturated with the horary literature and needed a hiatus, so I never got around to reading 'yet another book on horary.' Now, 15 years later, I have read the Moment of Astrology and I'm astounded by how thoughtful and erudite it is.This book is not for everyone. It is highly philosophical and some readers may be put off by that. Nonetheless, it is extremely well written and tackles the thorny philosophical issues that plague astrology. What I love about philosophy is that it forces us to make explicit the beliefs we live by. Cornelius does a superb job in fleshing out the beliefs that underlie the practice of astrology and makes a critical study of whether those beliefs hold up to logical or scientific scrutiny. He ends up contrasting the ""rational"" Ptolemaic model of the universe with the divinatory model in which astrology originated. Cornelius feels that all branches of astrology are rooted in divination (and based on my experience as an astrologer and student of divination, I agree with him). He rejects determinism, as most modern astrologers do, but he goes further and challenges the ancient Greek notion that the time of birth in some fundamental way is the key moment that determines the birth chart.While I understand what Cornelius is saying, I'm not sure I agree with his position in dethroning the moment of birth. This is based on my experience both with horary astrology and with numerous birth charts. I view the moment that the querent and astrologer jointly agree to cast a horary chart as the birth moment of their joint enterprise. If the querent is sincere and the astrologer understands the question and will be able to help, then the chart is almost always radical. In addition, I have had repeated experiences with birth charts which simply didn't look right based on my knowledge of the native and my gut feel for the chart. Invariably, when I ask the native to check the birth time or I review historical sources, the initial time given is inaccurate and a new 'more radical' birth time emerges. I wrote an article about this process that was published in the 2010 Winster Solstice issue of the NCGR journal.I'm not ready to give up Ptolemy's doctrine of origins just yet. It feels like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Perhaps that solution lies in an analogy with quantum physics. Is the electron a wave or a particle? It behaves like both and seems to exist as a probability wave until we try to observe it. Then it constellates in particle form. Maybe the birth moment and birth chart act something like an electron in the quantum world. They may resonate as a kind of probability wave and only constellate in divinatory form when the querent or native asks an astrologer to observe them in the world of human meaning and imagination. It seems to me that the world of astrology is much closer to the realm of quantum physics than the Newtonian world we all act as if we live in.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is truly one of the best astrology books I have ever read. It is wise, learned, and thought-provoking. It helps us understand that astrology is not science and cannot be proved or disproved by the scientific method. Instead, astrology is a symbolic divinatory system whose truth belongs to another realm of experience, just as the truth of poetry or great music belongs to other than the scientific realm.
Summary 4: This book is highly recommended by Robert Hand in a mini lecture he did at NORWAC and during his lecture to the entire group at The Blast 2007!
Summary 5: For years I and probably most astrologers thought astrology was objective. Through this book I realized a good astrology reading is made up of the astrologer, the client, and astrology concepts. Astrology can not be tested or practiced as the machine of destiny: if you have X in Y you will be such and such."
B000OVAGP4,Muddle Earth,"Summary 1: John Brunner (1934-1995) was a prolific science fiction writer, one of many from England that had great commercial success in the United States. Muddle Earth was published in 1993.Admirers of Mr. Brunner's writings, and I count myself as a member of that large community, will, I believe, be somewhat disappointed in this, his last novel. The story is a tongue in cheek satire concerning an individual returned to life - resurrected - after being ""frozen"" for many years. Not an original story concept by any means but ripe with possibilities. Brunner employees this theme as an opportunity to lampoon just about everything - handled with a sharp barb this approach could be enchanting but Brunner uses a cleaver. There are lots of puns, plays on other science fiction authors names (a medical machine is THEODOR Surgeon, another quack in Wrong Ghoulart and on and on) and a mammoth assortment of robots and disguised aliens playing historical persons - and some from Earth fiction - Sherlock Holmes and Watson for example.A interesting book for the dedicated Brunner fans, but casual readers would be better entertained reading his ""The Sheep Look Up"" - ""Shockwave Rider"" - or ""Stand on Zanzibar"".
Summary 2: Brunner's best is pretty spectacular, whether in thoughtful fables likeTraveler in Blackor crumbling futures likeThe Sheep Look Up. This, I regret, is not his best. Humorous SF has been around for years. ""The Hitch Hiker's Guide"" was relatively recent when this came out, and Pratchett's Discworld saga was well under way. Perhaps Brunner felt that he needed to write something in that genre to prove himself as a well-rounded writer.It gets off to a promising start. There are potentially humorous misunderstandings just before the start of his centuries-long cryogenic sleep, more just before the end of it, and a steady stream that carry him on a wild ride through the weirdness of that far-future Earth. For some odd reason, he wakes from his hibernation with after-effects that initially flatten his emotions. That's a clue, dear reader: the dullness within him goes well with the dullness that drags him from one laugh-track episode to the next. Every skit in the sequence falls somehow flat, from the in-jokes of the 1990s SF world to the outlandish names assigned to hero Rinpoche Gibbs, the faux Tibetan, and Nixy Anangaranga-Jones. Perhaps naming the poor girl for a traditional Indian sex manual was to have been mitigated by the fact that she's genetically engineered for irresistable beauty, but that plan fell flat as well.It doesn't really end, so much as collide with the back cover of the book, something it could have done long since without losing anything that mattered. I really did read it all the way through out of remembered loyalty to Brunner's finest work, but I'm not sure I should have bothered.-- wiredweird
Summary 3: ahh in the vein of mr adams,monsiour rankin and jimmmy crankie,muddle earth brings together a veritable phalanx of amusing wriggling and splish-splashing in the shallow end shoal of ideas.having never read any of the authors previous work ,I was surprised to find that shockwave rider was among his many classic works.A well funny read that has the added attribute of getting the brain cells cranking over.If this book were a fruit it would be an amusing shaped dingbung.which exists only in my head.ah well thats what imaginations all about i suppose.buy this book.it will do you much good."
B000NSKB76,The Workbook of Living Prayer,"Summary 1: This is by far the best small group study resource I have ever read. It is not surprising that almost half a million copies were sold in its first 20 years. As the title suggests, this book helps bring prayer to life.The book is divided into six weeks of daily individual studies, with an option of extending the study by another three weeks. Each week ends with a group meeting. Questions are provided within the book that encourage group members to share and assess the past week's adventure.Each day contains a powerful lesson, time for ""reflecting and recording"", and an assignment to carry you through the day. This is not just a well-organized scripture study. It gets right to the heart of applying scripture and clearing away the obstacles that are keeping us from a deeper prayer life. Each lesson flows seamlessly into the next, providing a steady stream of learning and growth.This resource will prove valuable for both the beginner and the seasoned 'prayer warrior'. Not only will it get you comfortable with prayer, it will get you downright excited about it. Want a deeper prayer life? Start here, and you won't be disappointed.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory
Summary 2: I purchased this workbook for use with church groups during Lent. The narrative was instructive and the use of scripture and other sources was relevant. We especially liked the suggestions for using each lesson throughout the day. We had our last session today and the feedback was very positive. Although we met in groups of 4 to 6, the workbook would be good for an individual also. However, the group setting encouraged more commitment than a person alone might be able to muster
Summary 3: This book has transformed my prayer life. I teach a lesson each week to my Sunday school class. We've all seen God answer our prayers.This is a real must-have.
Summary 4: Very thorough study of increasing your prayer life. Works very well with a group or as an individual study. The seven daily assignments are fairly short and very manageable. A very good product!
Summary 5: This material has been out a long time -- since the 70's but it's still as relevant and as helpful as ever. In this workbook Dunnam lays out a theology of prayer, teaches several different prayer practices and lays out the groundwork for an ongoing small group. That's pretty good for a ten week course!"
1591130921,The Kentucky Scout Series Book 1: The Shawnee Menace (Bk. 1),"Summary 1: The story is told in such a way that it holds interest from the first chapter to the last. Sadly, the author passed away on October 8, 2002, so there won't be any more in the series.
Summary 2: Shawnee Menace jumps out of the starting gate from the first page and kept me totally consumed in this intense story to the very last page. This book is clever because Roy enriches this story's historically based frame with relevant and entertaining characters and action. What's more is that this book successfully presents the harsh reality and romantic sense for the pioneer life.
Summary 3: a wonderful mixture of reality and action --interwoven with non-fiction/fictional characters, makes for an intriging spin on the amazing culture and history of our past struggles .
Summary 4: The book recounts a harrowing adventure, but ultimately it is the fearless nature of these people and their indefatigable will to fight back and survive that shines through. Without a doubt arousing tale of the heroic age of the pioneer exploration."
0813026210,E-mails from Scheherazad (Contemporary Poetry Series),"Summary 1: Mohja Kahf's poetry collection is better than prozac. Her poems link classical Arab characters with current day capitalistic trends (""Zuleika meets the Marlboro man across a delayed green""), and are punctuated, in the book's first half, with sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant Hijab Scenes, where the author encounters everyday prejudice but moves beyond self-pity and anger to humor and celebration. The result is charming and ultimately empowering. The first third of the book tells the plight of the immigrant- the Arab Muslim in particular- and uses the metaphor of landing on the moon. The second third is an ode to women and womanhood, and made me lift my head a little higher when I left the bookstore (this book under my arm.) The last third is a beautiful dialogue on political currents and events, and the poem in which Matisse characters come to life is jaw-dropping. The poetry collection offers something rare and brilliant as a stone: an intellectual journey from which one emerges with voyager dust.
Summary 2: &quot;E-mails from Scheherazad,&quot; by Mohja Kahf, is an excellent addition to the multiethnic body of U.S. poetry. A short bio at the end of the book notes that Kahf was born in Damascus, Syria, came to the U.S. as a child with her family, and has attained the rank of associate professor at the University of Arkansas.Kahf's poems cover a number of themes: the immigrant experience in America, cultural difference, women's issues, war, violence, and poetry itself. There are several poems that deal with the issue of the veil traditionally worn by Muslim women. A good representative poem is &quot;My Grandmother Washes Her Feet in the Sink of the Bathroom at Sears,&quot; a striking story of cross-cultural tension.Kahf's language is passionate, sometimes witty, and always clear and accessible. Her poems are richly spiced with many cultural references: to Wal-Mart, Robert Frost, Lt. Uhura, the &quot;Rubayat&quot; of Omar Khayyam, MTV, etc. She is particularly searing when reflecting on living in a post-9/11 world. Her compassionate but critical eye captures both the joy and tragedy of life. Highly recommended for college classes, book circles, or individual reading.
Summary 3: Mohja Kahf speaks to my heart, most powerfully, and with such beauty and humor as to make the bitterness go down easy. I love this book."
067232685X,SQLite,"Summary 1: This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information.
Summary 2: As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book).
Summary 3: SQLite is not intended to be a complete replacement to standard Database Management Systems. It IS, however, a good alternative to a full-blown database in some situations. Think of it as a simple database management system with NO RELATIONS - this may or may not be a problem for you and your project.I would never use SQLite for a web site of any complexity - MySQL and other RDBMS's are simply too plentiful, powerful and easy to use. One great application I've found is to use SQLite in, say, a C++ application such as a game for saving information like player stats and scores.

B00088ERFS,"Rab and his friends,","Summary 1: This tale is sweet and heartwarming, but be forewarned that it is VERY short. I read it in only a couple minutes. It is bittersweet and touching, not a &#34;happy ending&#34; story, but worthwhile reading.
Summary 2: Twain, Mrs. Clemens and John Brown were dear friends. Twain speaks of him constantly in his autobiography. I bought this story - it is much too brief to call it a book - on his recommendation. The story of Allie's surgery is amazing. Her courage, as depicted, at undergoing such an ordeal is awe-inspiring. His description of the wild young men of his youth is generously and wisely written. The whole tale may take you only twenty minutes to read, but Allie and John Brown will make an impreession, for sure.
Summary 3: Book delivered in high quality, received within a few days of placing the order. Excellent service."
0805055975,The Seasons of Rome: A Journal,"Summary 1: As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great.
Summary 2: This is old-school journalism at its best. Hofmann takes the year as it comes, and, journal style, writes a few sketches every month. Having lived in Rome for thirty years, he knows a lot about it, and he draws on his wealth of information, memory, impressions, and connections to give vivid pictures of the holidays that roll around or reflections prompted by chance events. His range is delightful -- from the pope to Vespa-riding robbers, from diplomats to gypsies, from horse shows to opera, from the mafia to the gattare [stray cat feeders]. If he needs statistics, he knows how to get them and unobtrusively adds them. He is not coy about using addresses, so I read with a map. I knew little about Rome when I began this book, but by the end I felt I knew where things were, what the flavor of the city is. It's not a travel guide, it's deep background for a visit.
Summary 3: Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (&quot;A Year in Provence,&quot; anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome. Nevertheless, his &quot;diary&quot; makes for a good read and a good history lesson.
Summary 4: The word ""journal"" is part of this book's title, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. After all, Paul Hoffman is a journalist. I've had the great good fortune to visit the Eternal City a few times, and reading Seasons is like taking another stroll along back streets and famous venues. It brought back happy memories and also reminders that Rome is a huge, noisy metropolis that is difficult to traverse. Hoffman also highlights that fact that Rome is populated by, well, Romans, as well as millions of other Italians, and conveys a sense of what it is like to live an ordinary life in an extraordinary place. The city described by this author is modern and genuine, and Hoffman's essays are devoid of the self-congratulatory tone of many other travel writers. This book is real."
0750921250,Tale of Mrs. William Heelis - Beatrix Potter,"Summary 1: Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private.
Summary 2: This is more a Heelis family history than a bio of Beatrix Potter. There are occasional mentions of Ms. Potter (or as she preferred to be called, Mrs. Heelis) but it does give you a relative's view of the well-known author. I enjoy family histories so I found it to be an interesting little book but if you're looking for a straight biography this may disappoint.
Summary 3: I wanted to read more about Beatrix Potter. This book was interesting but a little slow."
0673994635,Short Takes: Model Essays for Composition,"Summary 1: As a student using this book as a text in class I find it most helpful and interesting. Not only does it vary in topic, but it also gives you insight on new methods of interesting writing. Antoher plus is the length of each story with makes for easy reading. It really does live up to its name short takes.
Summary 2: This book is great in what it advertises: very short, diverse writing samples. However, as a complete text for a class, it's not comprehesive or cohesive enough to be used alone.
Summary 3: I HAVE USED PROBABLY 30 DIFFERENT FRESHMEN COMP. CLASSES AND DEVELOPMENTAL WRITING. UNTIL I DISCOVERED THIS BOOK ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO, MY CLASSES ARE MUCH MORE LIVELY, AND QUIET STUDENTS SYDDENLY SPEAK OUT ABOUT SECTIONS OF THE TEXT THAT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH.GREAT DIVERSE SECTIONS TO COVER IN CLASSROOM TALKS.IF INTERESTED, I CAN SEND COLLEGE ENGLISH TEACHERS MY COURSE SYLLABI USING &quot;SHORT TAKES.&quot;"
B0007EWYQ2,The power of sexual surrender,"Summary 1: The feminists are not going to like this book, but Dr. Robinson's arguments and evidence are beyond reproach.
Summary 2: I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross.
Summary 3: Marie Robinson wrote this book for all women to understand their own motives and actions in the marrage relationship. Many women are unhappy in their marrages without understanding their own motivation in making themselves unhappy. The book is written in chapters, each addressing the source of their disklikes, resentments, and dissatisfaction. The book also recommends ways for the women to help themselves realize that they can correct the problems with the result of being content in their relationship.The book is excellent for men who are married, especially when the cannot understand why their wife is not content with some aspect of the marrage. By thir understanding they can help the wife adjust her thinking by recognizing the, sometimes imaginary problems thus increasing their own happyness.Unfortunately, some women will not read the book when it is recommended, especially by the spouse, and like my own case, wind-up divorced with great financial to the spouses and children."
B000JD9SC4,Marx's Concept Of Man,"Summary 1: ""Marx's Concept of Man"" is essentially a pamphlet establishing the humanist, philosophical side of Marx as against the orthodox, Soviet view of Marx as tyrannical and economistic, and against the degree to which this view has seeped into academic literature in the West also. Famous Freudian Marxist Erich Fromm uses the ""Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts"" as well as ""The German Ideology"" to stress the importance of humanist concepts such as alienation, freedom, and creativity for Marx, and in so doing explains what these and similar terms mean in Marx' work. Fromm has clearly paid careful attention to Marx' philosophy, and this part of the book is quite good as a simple overview.The second half of the book covers the English translation of the aforementioned ""Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts"" by Tom Bottomore, as well as excerpts from various other works by and about Marx meaning to show his humanism, his good nature, and his sensitivity to culture. Of special interest are the excerpts from the memoirs of those who knew Marx, like his daughter Eleanor as well as Paul Lafargue. These works are often quoted, but rarely does one find a larger part in English, not even in McLellan's biography.Fromm goes a bit overboard here and there in stressing Marx' 'spiritual' nature. Although nothing Fromm writes is of itself incorrect, it may unwittingly reinforce the old canard of Marxism 'really' being a religion, and Marx a millennarian prophet, and so on. Fromm obviously rejects this old refrain, but should have made that clearer. In other aspects this collection is an interesting primer on Marx as thinker on human action and human nature, and sheds good light on this side of Marxist thought for those not familiar with it.
Summary 2: Marx? Communism? Please!That's the gut reaction of most of us. Why is this? Why is the man who's ideas stimulated nearly half the world to revolution automatically rejected without even being seriously looked at by most of us the U.S. today? What's that you say? ""History shows us that communism is an impossible system that leads to the greatest tyranny.""The fact is Marx is much more than communism. His most famous work is not called Communism but Capital. (The manifesto was a small pamphlet next to the thousands of pages of the planned four volumes of Capital). He is strongest in his analysis of the very history and machinery of this economic system. In fact, it is in his critique of capitalism (not his proposition of communism) that he is most original.Today, we see yet another crisis in global capitalism. Almost all of us who seek understanding of this crisis do so using the very same conceptual tools of the capitalist doctrine itself. But what if there are incorrect assumptions that the governments, universities and media networks of the world continuously overlook?Marx's Concept of Man serves as an introduction to such an analysis. It is a compilation of various manuscripts of the early Marx and is quite digestible--especially after Fromm's preface. Erich Fromm--a significant 20th century philosopher in his own right--introduces us to some of the most timeless aspects of Marx's concept of man in a way that makes his thought significant to this day.
Summary 3: Erich Fromm, displays a different profile of Karl Marx. According to Fromm, Marx is very different than the one told by the Russian Communists. Fromm tries to show the humanist ideas of Marx and he describes Marx's philosophy as a synthesis of humanism and naturalism. There are also good descriptions of what socialism means: ""Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation."".Fromm describes the Marxist socialism as the heirs of propethic Messianism.This book is really interesting because Fromm tries to explain the humanistic values in socialism.Indeed, all the communist propaganda has claimed that their way is the real Marxist system; however Fromm claims that their system was just a crude communism which neglected human beings and humanistic values.
Summary 4: This is a book that should, but given the existing political culture, won't be made required reading in schools and universities.Eric Fromm was a humanist writer who lived from 1900 to 1980, and exerted a strong influence on Baby Boomers with his popular books. This book about Humanistic Marxism shook the intellectual world when it was first published in 1961. It rattled the conventional wisdom at the time it was first published. The West had, as Fromm readily admits, a glaring misconception of what Marxism meant. They could hardly be blamed for this misunderstanding. The only example the West had to look towards to see Marxism in action was to observe the Soviet Union. The Eastern Block shares responsibility in misconstruing the meaning of Marx. Its monumental government apparatuses, unwieldy bureaucracies, its virulent oppression of human rights, all these characteristics were definitely NOT how Marx envisioned a communistic society.Fromm goes into great detail on the humanistic philosophy of Marxism. If Hobbes' Leviathan emerged to protect man from a state of nature, the true goal of society according to Marx is to provide the conditions by which man may reestablish his relationship with nature, with others, with society at large, and with himself. The impediment to this reestablishment is alienation, a common concept of Marx, which drives a wedge between man and the other elements to his life and to himself. As Fromm repeatedly reminds the reader, alienation does not simply exist in Western societies; it is equally prevalent in those countries under a so-called ""Communist"" form of government. Fromm states that the governments of Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev were simple totalitarian states.There is a decided spiritual aspect to Marx, in that the goal of a person's life is self-realization. This self-realization, however, is one which allows a person to achieve their own personal goals, based on that person's abilities, talents and labor.Fromm was addressing a world in the middle of the Cold War, and published in an America just emerging from the crushing conformity of the 1950's. It has continued relevance today, where the societal pressures are hidden and the urge to conform reemerging.This is a short book and can be read in two or three sittings. It is a well worth read.
Summary 5: ...someone dusted off Marx and took a good psychological look at the wealth in his writings! One needn't be a Marxist (I am not) to appreciate this fine book. My one concern is that Fromm is to Marx as Kaufmann is to Nietzsche: both men either ignore or euphemize the weaknesses in the visionaries they write about (e.g., Kaufmann's remark that Nietzsche's hateful, cynical, and demeaning remarks about women &quot;do him little credit&quot;). Nevertheless, this book provides a good compensation for the Western tendency to demonize a man very much misunderstood by those who turned his writings to political purposes."
0440430089,Good Luck Arizona Man,"Summary 1: This book is one of the funniest ever! Years ago, when I drove my latency-aged children across country, we had the book in the car, and to avoid sibling conflict on the long road trip, I had my daughter read it aloud. It's one of my most treasured memories. It has everything: Treasure, bad guys, good guys (Indians), clever kids who win the day. The publisher needs to get its head examined for not keeping it in print.
Summary 2: I too read this book as a pre-teen some 30 years ago. I read and enjoyed many young adventure books (Zilpha Keatley Snyder's novels, The Three Investigators series), but this is the only one that I read over and over and over. There are passages that would make me laugh out loud every time! My mother will be selling my childhood home soon, and I hope to find my old, dogeared copy when I visit this summer so I can pass it to my son. If I don't, I'll find a used copy for him. All kids should read this treasure of a book!
Summary 3: I had read this 30 years ago or so when I was a kid and I had fond memories of the book but couldn't remember what it was about. So, I bought a copy to read to my 9-year old daughter as a bedtime story and we were not disappointed. It is captivating, but you have to read the whole thing for all the pieces to come together and for the story to make sense. My daughter had me read some pages over and over because they were so funny.
Summary 4: Like the others, above, I am amazed this book is not in print. It is on my ""must read"" list; my father read it to me, I read it to my wife and children, and I encourage lots of people to read it. The publisher who didn't want to reprint it must be the cousin of the guy who turned down publication of the first Harry Potter book.
Summary 5: As with the other two people who have reviewed this book, I was introduced to it by my father. I very much enjoyed listening to this story. In the 20 years since, I have read this book several times - my copy is now ragged! I have also enjoyed reading this book to young people while working as a day care provider. There is enough mischief and mayhem, enough sneaky twists, and enough action to keep your attention. The language is, at times, poetic, at other times just plain funny. It is truly a crime that this book is not in print. I want to send a copy to my eleven year old half-sister, but don't want to give mine up!"
B000HU0H88,Inspiring Hymns,"Summary 1: This was the hymnal used by a church I attended when I started Bible College. It has a great collection of hymns. This hymnal introduced me to the great and hard hitting song ""He Was Not Willing That Any Should Perish"", which is hard to find and absent from most hymnals.On the quirky side -- this hymnal also introduced me to the Charles Wesley classic ""And Can It Be"". The full version has five verses with an ABABCC rhyme scheme and uses the last two lines of the first verse as the chorus. In this hymnal, they only do three verses; that's okay because it's common for hymnals to not include all the verses. However, they dropped the CC lyrics, meaning that the chorus for all three verses are the last two lines of the first verse repeated twice. That makes me shake my head.Is that a reason to forget this hymnal? No. It has a great set of songs.
Summary 2: I value this book highly. It contains a lot of the really good old hymns that are no longer readily available. The book arrived in a reasonable timeframe and was in good condition. It was a bargain at the price I paid.
Summary 3: I have this old hymnal, and it has a great selection of known and cherished hymns of the Christian church. When my daughter wanted one for occasional use with their worship team, I looked on Amazon to provide her with one like I had, because of the thorough selection of well known and loved older hymns. We are happy campers!You may use the review,However, do not send me advertisements.I do not want to get offers and advertisements. I thought I was doing a review, not signing up for unwanted advertising. What is the deal? Linda Greene"
0500282684,Hip Hotels: France,"Summary 1: This book is one of the most beautifully photographed I've seen in years. Not only did it inspire me to stay in the Villa Gallici when I was in France over the Christmas holidays, but I have spent hours poring over the gorgeous pictures, finding inspiration for the decor of my new house.One great drawback of the book is that it doesn't include a map of France at the front or back, showing where the hotels are located. (My boyfriend is French, and even he didn't know some of the towns where the hotels are situated.)
Summary 2: I bought this book for my designer husband because of the architecture and interior design of the hotels. He loved it. As the travel planner of the family I found myself reading about the hotels and areas we haven't visited yet, and was inspired to vary our usual French holidays to include some of the hotels in the book. If the rates in the book are fairly accurate, many of the hotels are accessible to most travelers or within reason for a splurge stay. I would have liked more and bigger photos of some places like La Columbe d'Or, but generally the descriptions and photos were interesting as well as attractive. This is not a Fromer's guide or hotel guide but a glimpse of some of the more interesting places to stay in France.
Summary 3: Hi. We got the Valentine's Day [money]round trip air fare to Brussels on SAS and were looking for a place to stay in the Champagne region of France. We used this book to find Les Champs des Oiseaux in Troyes, France. Since we were traveling with a 2 year old, I wrote the hotel in advance to find a room where we wouldn't disturb other guests if Luke had jet lag and wanted to play at 2 am. They identified this suite for us (only [money] per night), and it was perfect. We stayed 4 nights and didn't want to leave.
Summary 4: Mr. Ypma is a gifted photographer and a careful writer - a rare combination. Great selection of hotels. It is the perfect coffee table version of cool new online services such as the great &quot;tablethotels.com&quot;
Summary 5: A truly beautiful, excellent book.Essentially perfect. The year's coolest coffee table book.A must have for any Franocphile or lover of hotels or design.There are four in the series (such as &quot;Hip Hotels - City&quot;). &quot;France&quot; is the most beautiful and personal one, a super achievement by the author.Bravo."
B0006D6DYS,"Philadelphia, here I come!","Summary 1: We all have our little people within ourselves, that little voice that criticizes us when we know we are lying to ourself. Friel took this one step further: he put this self on stage. The main character in this play, Gar O'Donnel, is divided into a public and private half in this play on Gar's last night in Ireland before he goes to philadelphia. The public half is Gar's usual self: boisterous with friends, shy around his father and failed girlfriend, and respectful towards the old housekeeper. However at every step the private Gar is by his side, railing against the terrible monotony of life and leaving. The ending confrontation between Gar(s) and his father is at once moving and terribly tragic.
Summary 2: In this play, Friel beautifully captures the loss felt that comes with leaving the green fields of Ireland to look for a better life. Friel step by step mirrors the way of life in Ireland perfectly, bring home to us all the reality of life in those days in rural Ireland. His father, unable to express his own emotions, can but make idle small talk to the son he my never see again......Gars friends, the &quot;boys&quot;, though over 20 still boast of fictional conquests as if they were in the grip of adolesence....the sufficating sameness of day to day life in a rural village, aspects of Irish past, and sometimes present society which is often over looked by Irish writers are brillantly portrayed in this journey inside the mind of a boy about to leave all he knows, and hopefully become a man in the process. &quot;Philadelphia, Here I come&quot; is a story to be cherished by all that have made the journey themselves, those who still remember the Ireland of the past, and those seeking an insider view of a young mans mind. It is a must, something that you will read again and again, and something which everyone, both Irish and otherwise, will identify with forever.
Summary 3: I first read this play at the age of 16, as I played the part of SB in a production in secondary school. It's on the English syllabus in Ireland, attesting to its significance in modern Irish drama. I like the play but its one major failing is that Gar, especially through Gar Private, is very often reduced to a stereotypical, stage Irish man. While his constant jokes do serve to highlight his frustration at the monotony of his life, and especially the lack of communication between him and his father, his constant chatter, and unbridled spontaneity are too overpowering and detract from what is otherwise a beautiful play. My favourite scene, and the scene I loved playing most is when SB is alone on stage and goes over to Gar's room and looks at his son's suitcases. For the first time, the mask drops and we see that he is a man of feeling who can not voice his inner hurt and turmoil. The end is lovely, the theme of memory, deceptive and alusive.
Summary 4: This is set in play format with a strange inclusion of the antagonists alter ego the two characters are Public the man everyone sees and Private the man no one sees or hears only Public can hear him. Together they make up Gar. The play is set the night before Gar is set to leave Ireland and move to Philadelphia. The story focuses not on his leaving but more on his escape from his unexciting father. The inclusion of Private Gar added humour and explanation of events in the play. An enjoyable play with greats dialog and a good story.
Summary 5: Of course this was Brian Friel's first big success. It should have been. It's about the mysteries of immigration, the loss of what's left behind, the hope of what's hoped and longed for, the inability to feel what you say and to say what you feel, love lost and given away, and how we are not what we seem, or even what we think we are. It's also about not really understanding all this and still doing something. And it's funny."
0072877715,Adv Programming Using VB.Net w/ 60 day Trial & Student CD,"Summary 1: This book has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. I wouldn't pay $25 for it.The examples given are really worthless because all they basically do is drag and drop components and controls (almost anybody can figure that out). I would like to see more code, especially in the Database section. I mean the book is OK if you only paid $20 to $30. (Are they really selling the 60-day trial version of VS.NET?)
Summary 2: This is a very average quality Text Book. It will not be a book for a beginning programmer to grab and expect to run with. The book has quite a few vaugue examples but most are fairly well documented. But, you better have some VB/VS background. The writers skip the basics here.This is an expenseive book for what you will be getting. I highly recommend anyone wanting to buy this to spend a little while flipping through to see what you will be getting. Buyer Beware! There are several better books avail on this subject.However, This is not a terrible book. It is just ""Very Average"" as Text Books go. For the price, I would recommend finding something more friendly. Or, at least try to wait for a newer revision and see if Bradley & Millspaugh will tick-up the quality when they rewrite for .NET 2005. If they don't, grab something cheaper and better, like WROX Beginning VB.NET Databases. If you're forced to get this for a class, good luck. I hope your prof is a better than this book.I give it two and half stars for average content. But rounded down to 2 stars for being over priced.
Summary 3: I've been programming webforms in VB.NET for a couple of months now and I've read a number of books on the subject. This book is excellent if you have some programming experience preferably object oriented languages. Sure it blazes thru some of the key OOP concepts but if you want to learn that stuff get a different book. What this book did for me was that it simply gave me different views on (for instance) concurrency control, data access, etc. There were a bunch of good reusable code snippets as well. Obviously it is a book intended for students although I found it very useful for both winform programming as well as webform programming. I just wish it had even more pages!Now go get it!"
0864422768,Lonely Planet Lao Phrasebook (Lonely Planet : Language Survival Kit),"Summary 1: The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around.
Summary 2: Besides my Lao Dictionary, this is *the* Lao book I carry around daily with me. I wish I could post a photo of my worn out dog-eared copy. I agree w/ the one reviewer who said the transliteration is a little wacky, however the Lao script is generally ""spot on"". (I'll mention transliteration with Lao is a less than exact science) It's one of the few if only books outside of the books attempting to teach Lao that handle things like Grammar.. very handy for the traveler. It also throws some Lao culture in for good measure to make sure you don't do something offensive to the local people. Great book, worth the money and besides... it's so small you can fit it in your pack/bag pretty easy.
Summary 3: this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced.
Summary 4: This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a ""comprehensive dictionary"". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it.
Summary 5: The Lonely Planet phrasebooks have come a long way since the days when the foreign script portion was merely hand-written in the space beside the romanized portion. The Lao phrasebook is representative of that new generation, and it is pretty impressive. Along with all the usual categories of phrases one would expect to see (greetings, directions, lodging, food, shopping, health, numbers, dates, emergencies, etc.), the splendidly informative introduction provides an interesting background on the spoken language and script, followed by a great section on pronunciation and grammar. There are interesting cultural notes dispersed throughout the book, and a vocabulary list at the end. Its compact size makes it ideal to carry in one's pocket. On the down side the marking system used in the romanized portion to indicate Lao tones is a little confusing and under-explained, but all-in-all a great little phrasebook."
0765605376,Echoes Among the Stars: A Short History of the U.S. Space Program,"Summary 1: As I began reading &quot;Echoes Among the Stars,&quot; I was immediately taken with Walsh's prose-like style. His poetic descriptions of man's fascination with the moon and John Glenn's return to space make this book thoroughly enjoyable and very readable. It is written so smoothly and with such emotion that I actually forgot I was reading a nonfiction, historical study. Walsh's love and knowledge of the subject make it easy to understand the outer space passions of such famous figures as Stephen Hawking and Tom Hanks. His thoughtful, storytelling-style will help readers such as myself not only visualize Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's famous journey, but feel what they and the country felt and experienced when they took that fateful stroll on the cratered moon surface.I was no space buff, but I am now, thanks to Walsh's thorough and clear explanations, and attention to the historical significance of the many facets and missions that made up NASA's successful space-aeronautics program. As Walsh juxtaposes the development and advances in the program against the important events taking place in the U.S. at the time, as well as the Soviet's own space program, I felt as though I not only was reading about the time and the events in question, but had experienced them myself. This was a courageous and successful approach that resulted in a wonderfully interesting and emotion-filled retelling of the adventure that is the U.S. space program.
Summary 2: Echoes Among the Stars by Patrick J. Walsh is not only a concise lesson in the history of the U.S. Space Program, but also a lyrical tribute to man's quest for knowledge. Walsh's book methodically and elegantly recalls the missions that led up to Neil Armstrong's first captivating step on the moon, fulfilling President John F. Kennedy's vision, and continues to trace the development of the Space Program through the voyages of the space shuttles.Walsh imparts the episodes that inform America's modern psyche with the adventuresome spirit with which they were undertaken. I keenly felt the valor of the astronauts. Creating a parallel between the space programs of the USSR and the United States, Walsh demonstrates how the competition between the programs led to ""a handshake across the heavens."" By placing the events of the Space Program within the political and social context of the United States, the magnitude of NASA's accomplishments becomes even more striking. The useful chronology at the end of the book is a wonderful, succinct reference of achievements and tragedies sustained by both the Soviet and American space programs alongside political and social events.In a nation that seems to be consuming itself with political angst, Echoes reminds the reader of the powerful patriotism that has made the United States great. Passages relaying the greatest accomplishments of the astronauts-John Glenn's first earth orbit, Ed White's first American spacewalk, Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon, Tom Stafford and Alexei Leonov's handshake-as well as the greatest tragedies-the losses of the Apollo I and Challenger crews-are treated with accomplished storytelling skills that left me filled with emotion. A well-crafted history, Echoes is also a rarity-a truly graceful narrative. Echoes belongs on every well-appointed book shelf in the United States.
Summary 3: First of all, let me state that the subtitle of this book should really be something like, &quot;A Short History of the Manned US Space Program up to 1975,&quot; since there is very little information on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs and almost nothing on unmanned missions. About half of the book concentrates on the Apollo program. On the flip side, there are some nice discussions on the competing Russian programs. I think a good rating for this book should be 3 stars if you're a space nut and know a lot about the space program and 5 stars if you're a novice space nut. Regardless of your level of space knowledge you'll find this a well written and easy to read book.The book opens with a small chapter on the early unmanned space race to place the first satellites in Earth Orbit. The book then movies into the Mercury and Gemini programs and presents the competing Russian projects. The section on the Gemini program presents a good summary of each mission, its problems and accomplishments and shows how this program proved many of the concepts, like docking, needed to make Apollo the success that it was.The next few sections of the book cover the Apollo missions to the moon and the various steps of the program. The first chapter covers the Apollo 1 fire, the subsequent investigation and changes made to the vehicle. I found this chapter especially refreshing since it avoided the gruesome details of the astronauts' deaths which is not always the case with some books on the space race. The next section covers the precursor missions, Apollos 7-10, which led up the first moon landing which, of course, receives its own chapter. The next two chapters cover Apollo 12 - 17 and provide some very good summaries of these missions. It is interesting to note that during these times, the comparative Russian manned space program is almost at a complete standstill.After the moon landing chapters, about half of the book, the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project are discussed. I found the section on Skylab extremely disappointing. Here was a program that more than doubled US spaceflight time and which conducted many important micro-gravity related experiments, yet it only receives six page of text, less than half that of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project chapter. The final chapter of the book covers the last 27 years of manned flight and only examines the most important missions. It just seems that the author ran of steam covering everything that happened after the moon landings took place."
0470821019,Better Stock Trading: Money and Risk Management,"Summary 1: The book really starts out examining how risk management can affect a system with positive expectations. The main point he is making is that your average profit should be greater than average loss, which is true enough. Unfortunately, there is an implied assumption in this section that suggests you can change the stop without impacting the probabilities of success -- i've found this not to be true in my own trading. I would certainly liked to have seen some mention of this in the book, but that's a bit of a nitpick to be quite honest.In the book, Mr. Guppy uses the 2% risk model Elder uses. However, there are bits missing. For example, he has no real way of limiting risk. He has a model whereby through diversification and position limits, he will limit outstanding risk to 20%. However, from my brief reading of the book (I plan to go over it more thoroughly later), there is nothing stopping you from entering another 20% worth of positions, and another 20%. Stopping your entire portfolio out several times. Sure, I hear you say, this could never happen to a top trader -- however, if it happened to Steve Walton &lt;See Stock Market Wizards>, I suspect it can happen to you.Overall, I think this is an excellent book, and I learned quite a bit from it. Mr. Guppy's writing style may not be quite as polished as some writers, but I think it's still quite good. If you are a position trader, i'd highly recommend this book -- if you opt for the swing or daytrading timeframes, I think you might be better off with Elder or Tharp -- although it certainly does no harm to study all of these authors, as they each have a lot of really good things to say about this topic. I think this book may indeed be destined to be in fine company, alongside Elder and Tharp. This work is much stronger and generally more useful than his earlier work, Market Trading Tactics.
Summary 2: I traded for over a year before I read this book. My bookshelf is full of books on technical analysis, day trading, swing trading, candlesticks, etc., but none of them are all about money management. As the author demonstrates, with charts, graphs and examples, how you manage your trades is more important than the accuracy of your technical analysis. Various entry and exit stratagies are compared graphically to show you the dollar results obtained for the same trade using different stratagies. I highly recommend this book, to the beginning trader and to the experienced trader whose portfolio contains a number of losing positions.
Summary 3: Very good book. Interesting & useful ideas on money management, but needs to be carefully read & reviewed for errors. The examples have some errors, and are not always consistent with the text. Too much detail on Asian trading for an American audience. Too many notes to see the authors other books & services. The references to Excel spreadsheets are incomplete. Some camparisons, like with zero cost trading may be misleading, & ignore other factors, like effective stops."
B00086SPTE,Vein of iron,"Summary 1: Ellen Glasgow (1873-1945) was a successful writer during her lifetime, but, alas, her work is too little known today. It is due for a revival. Glasgow lived most of her life in Richmond, Virginia, and was critically praised as an early naturalist writer. She attempted to describe the South without the romantic accretions of &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology that arose following the Civil War.Glasgow wrote Vein of Iron in 1935, and the book placed second on the best-seller lists that year. It is typical for her work which bridged the gap between serious and popular literature. I first read this novel three years ago and was pleased to have the opportunity to reread it as part of a book group. I was surprised at how much I had missed -- and probably got wrong -- on my first reading. If serious literature can be characterized as a book that bears reading slowly and more than once, then Vein of Iron has met this standard for me.The book is set primarily in rural Virginia from about 1901 through 1935 (running into the first term of President Roosevelt). The story centers on the Fincastle family of Scotch-Irish descent which has lived in what has become a rundown manse in the small fictional village of Ironside since before the Revolutionary War.Several family members get a great deal of attention in the novel. Ada Fincastle is a young woman in love with a young man named Ralph McBride. She loses Ralph, as a result of a forced marriage to a rich, selfish girl, Janet Rowan, who claims Ralph got her pregnant. She ultimately marries Ralph, but only after a two-day torrid affair in the woods before the divorce between Ralph and Janet is concluded. Ralph returns from WW I cynical and disillusioned and the couple struggle to retain their love for one another.Ada's father, John Fincastle, is the other major character in the story. Fincastle is a Presbryterian minister who has been defrocked &quot;after he had told the Presbytery he rejected the God of Abraham but accepted the God of Spinoza.&quot; (p.45) Fincastle has spent his life writing a multi-volume work of philosophy, heavily influenced by a combination of philosophical naturalism, German idealism, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and, I think especially, Buddhism and Eastern thought. Glasgow herself was a religous seeker of an unorthodox cast who had been fascinated with Buddhism when young. I found her portrait of John Fincastle compelling.The main characters also include Ada's grandmother as well as Fincastle's wife, who dies early in the book, and a character named Aunt Meggie all of whom retain traditional Presbryterian religious convictions and all of whom are sympathetically portrayed.Much of the theme of the book is stated in the title, as the characters, regardless of their differences in religious outlook maintain their fortitude and strength in the face of difficulty, adversity, and change. Besides fortitude and interior toughness, the second large theme of the book, I think, is human compassion. As the family suffers and observes the suffering of others during the Great Depression, John and ada, in particular, come to realizew and to put into practice the value of limiting one's own egocentrism and trying to work to alleviate the sufferings of others. There is a Buddhist mantra that is repeated at several important places in this novel: &quot;May all beings be delivered from suffering&quot; -- known as the lovingkindness (or metta) meditation that seemed to me initially and still seems to me upon rereading to be at the heart of this book.The book has excellent descriptions of life in rural Virginia and of the growth of the urban South in a larger fictious city called Queenborough. Industrialization and the suffering resulting from the Depression are portrayed well. There are also sympathetic, non-stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans, uncommon in a work of this era.For all the descriptions of place and the intensity of the love story, I still concluded on my reading that the main focus of this book was spiritual. Glasgow writes knowingly both of the loss of faith in traditional Western religions and also of the need for the spiritual values of wisdom, self-understanding, and compassion. Her book has a serious tone throughout and her quest remains distinctly modern.I found, as I did when I first read Vein of Iron that much of the book is overwritten and that its tone is melodramatic in places. In spite of that, Vein of Iron works on many levels. I found it primarily a picture of a timeless spiritual quest. It encourages the reader away from the materialism of the everyday, whether found in rural Virginia or anywhere else, to search for meaning, wisdom, and compassion, regardless of whether the reader finds these values within or without the boundaries of a traditional religous faith.
Summary 2: (...)Vein of Iron, written in 1935, is the saga of a Virginia family who live through changing times. It starts in 1901 when the central character Ada is 10 years old, and she is deeply disappointed when, even though she has saved up her money for a doll with real hair, she has to settle for a cheaper doll that she doesn't want. This sets the tone of the book, which is filled with the realities of life's struggles and disappointments. It also deeply explores religion and faith as Ada's father is a former Presbyterian minister who has lost his faith and there is constant conflict between right and wrong as well as tradition and change.The title refers to the vein of iron within the characters, especially the women, which keeps them going throughout adversity as they struggle through their personal challenges as well as the social changes creating upheaval around them. The love of Ada's life, Ralph McBride, is stolen by the trickery of a supposed best friend. He eventually does come back to her as a soldier off to fight in the World War and their two-day illicit romance results in a pregnancy, which alienates her from her beloved Grandmother. Later, after her lover comes back from war, disillusioned by his experiences on the battlefield, their marriage is marked with more disappointment and struggle as they leave their beloved mountain home and move to a large town. When the Depression hits, and her husband loses his job, she finds work selling gloves in a shop where her wages keep getting reduced and the family struggles to put food on the table. There's always compassion though for those even less fortunate and we get to know their small community of neighbors.There were a lot of themes going on at once in spite of the simplicity of the words. Yet the story itself was so engaging that I was reading it on the bus one day and went two stops past my usual stop. The sense of place is dominant throughout and I was transported into the author's world. It was not always a pleasant place to be, especially during those Depression years, but I totally related to it all, and admire the ""vein of iron"" in the author, as well as in her characters. Recommended.
Summary 3: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!
Summary 4: Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are ""overwritten,"" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."

Summary 5: In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book."
B0006Y4ZQ0,Unlock your mind and be free!,"Summary 1: This is a book written by a general practioner who became so enchanted with the power of hypnotherapy that he changed his specialty to accommodate his newfound love for psychiatry. Dr Barnett makes a bold move at creating and following a novel metaphor through out the book. He states that the mind is analogous to the criminal system and that through no fault of our own that prisons are created within our mind. He feels that there are many medical illnesses that have their origins within the 4 prisons mind. First, phobias are unresolved conflicts that have triggers that the patient attributes to the phobia rather than the unresolved conflict. The trigger produces anxiety, which is a manifestation of a powerful fear that imprisons the mind. The second is repressed anger. He states that suppressed anger is like a sleeping volcano that can erupt in the form of a headache, peptic ulcer, back pain, hypertension or obesity. The third prison is pain and sadness, which he feels central to the genesis of all emotional illnesses. He makes a convincing argument for the earlier the rejection, the more devastating the effects because the client has fewer resources with which to deal with it. Asthma, depression, drugs and smoking are attributed to rejection. The final prison is that of guilt which is consistently a potent factor in the production of emotional illness. Impotence, frigidity, obesity, skin diseases and suicide many times have their origins rooted to guilt.Dr Barnet makes the argument that a crime is any act that endangers the peace of society. The analogy here is that a crime of guilty is often self-imposed on children who interfere with their parent's harmony. He makes the bold move to suggest that many of these self-imposed crimes are perpetrated in utero. His argument makes sense even though it flies in the face of western medicine. He states that at least on a subconscious level, the child hears and feels what his parents say or feel about him. The most convincing argument for this is that of gender conflict. It makes sense that a child would have conflict with their gender if their parents were disappointed that they did not get the sex that they desired. This suggestion that they are not desired at birth, places the child into a prison of guilt as the child grows. Prisons of guilt and fear can also develop from similar circumstances.The court of the mind is similar to other court systems. When an individual is accused of an emotional crime, his mind makes a decision that is binding and will determine that individual's future. This courtroom analogy goes further when delving into psychiatric evidence that we all operate from more than one ego state. To fully understand the complex metaphor the ego states must be reviewed. The three states of the mind are the child, the parent, and the adult. The child is the first state and is the feelings part of our being that provides drive and energy. The child ego says: ""I like or I want."" Very quickly the parent portion of the ego develops that is essentially mimicry of the child's parents. The function of the parent is to gather all information it can about the people in the immediate environment of the child so that they may respond in a harmonious manner. The parent ego says: ""I should."" The adult develops after years of maturing and is concerned with collecting information about the world and filing it for future reference. The adult ego says things like: ""I can, or I will."" In the court of the mind, the accused is always the child that is being prosecuted for an attribute that has caused offense. The prosecutor is usually the parent, usually the mother. The accuser is always someone within the child's immediate environment, who is distressed by who they are. The judge unfortunately in early life is the child's parent ego whose job it is to protect the child with its archaic methodology. The defense team is the child who thinks that they are only doing what is right for them. When the verdict comes from the parent ego state, a sentence is passed that ensures the crime will never recur. The punishment is always fashioned to fit the crime. If the expression of a feeling has been found unacceptable, the parent may decree that the sentence is to withhold any expression of that forbidden feeling. Often times the toddler verdict can be ""you must not exist,"" ""you must never feel angry,"""" you are not lovable,"" ""you must not succeed,"" ""you must not be afraid,"" ""you must not love,"" or ""you must not think."" The implications of these decisions are long reaching and consistent with emotional problems experienced in adulthood. The decision is reinforced with guilt. Whenever the child thinks about performing the act, the immaturely developed parent ego state merely flashes the results of the last transgression on the child's emotional television screen and guilty foreboding occurs.The release from prison can only occur when the information is re-presented (re-trial) with the mature adult ego state as a judge and a pardon can be justly handed down. However the initial incident is deep in the bowels of the subconscious. Hypnosis is used to reveal the lost information to the adult so that a correct judgment can be determined. Often times this re-judgment can occur on a subconscious level and still be effective.Rehabilitation must also occur after the pardon. To resolve old bad habits, new positive reinforcement must be ongoing. Three rules need to be followed for rehabilitation to occur. First, they must promise to stop putting themselves or their feelings down. Second, the individual must promise to never again allow anyone to themselves or their feelings down. Third, they must never knowingly put anyone else down.The author goes onto justify how these prisons of the mind will manifest in physical ailments and detailed methodology on how a trained hypnotherapist can go about resolving these crimes. If a hypnotherapist is not available, he goes into detail on how self-hypnosis can help. The book concludes with case studies and information on how the power of the mind has been useful in healing disease.Overall, this was an excellent book with innovative thoughts that are far ahead of its time. The in utero development of the subconscious mind and the far-reaching effects of adverse parental interaction are definitely plausible.
Summary 2: Dr. Barnett's book is fairly short and easy to read. It contains an excellent explanation of the root causes of emotional (and many physical) problems, using a Transactional Analysis model. By using hypnosis to get at these root causes, he has been able to free many patients from depression, addictions, obesity, and psychosomatic medical disorders. It was particularly useful for me that he has the credentials of having been a family practitioner for many years prior to entering the full time practice of hypnosis. Many books on hypnosis aim to clear up emotional disturbances by using more superficial means, such as direct suggestion. Barnett does regression therapy to truly get at the root cause of the problem, and cure it. He makes an excellent point that it is not our negative emotions which cause us problems, but our resistance to feeling the truth of our emotions that is the REAL cause of stress and unhappiness. A must read for all serious hypnosis practitioners.
Summary 3: In a world often fraught with depression and emotional prisons...Dr. Edgar A. Barnett gives us this enlightened book to show us step by step the way that we can turn the key and free ourselves through the use of analytical hypnotherapy. The chapter on self hypnosis has taught me great relaxation skills. I have been a fan of this book for over 15 years and find it as relative today as it was when it was first published. This newest version comes with a wonderful new cover design and clean crisp text. Wonderfully written to be easily understood by both the student of hypnosis and the average reader. Well worth the asking price.
Summary 4: It has been a long time since I purchased this book from a hypnotherapy school, but it is an under-appreciated classic. Examine ways you may be in a, ""prison"" of your own making. Written by a compassionate, medically trained hypnotist.
Summary 5: Unlock Your mind was really 'the missing link' for me. Since I read the book, sessions in my professional life as a hypnotherapist has become a lot easier. The metaphor about putting your feelings into prison as a child and giving them a second chance as an adult has helped my clients to understand their dispair and made suppressed feelings come alive to live a secure life. The persons change - and become free!"

0874830826,Buried Treasures of the American Southwest,"Summary 1: This book is a must for the bookshelves of treasure hunters and armchair dreamers. The history of lost gold and hidden treasures in the American Southwest is summarized here as well as it can be.
Summary 2: Wendall Hall's book, Buried Treasures of the American Southwest"" is not a bad book; however, it does not include Southern Calif or Nevada, and only 4 common legends in Arizona. Has 14 legends from AR, 4 from NM, 5 from OK and 9 from TX. Arkansas and Oklahoma are not the states that come to mind when I think of the Amerian Southwest. Title of the book is wrong. Any book with this title must include more of the legends of AZ,S. CA and NV., and save the 28 stories (out of only 36)regarding AR, OK and TX for another book.Found Thomas Penfield book, ""Dig Here- Lost Mines and Buried Treasure of the Southwest"" better because it includes the ""southwest"". It also has a much better index system, linking the legends to state maps. Penfield'b book covers AZ well, but also is light in regard to NV and S. CA.Eugene Conrotto's book, ""Lost Gold and Silver Mines of the Southwest"" has the most legends from S. CA, NV and AZ, but is not indexed and organized very well. Pretty much just jumps from (good) story to story. I ended-up cutting the book up and organizing the stories by State in file folders for reference during future OHV trips.
Summary 3: You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
Summary 4: My husband enjoyed the book very much and will read more books in this series. This is the 4th one from this author I have gotten for him."
0738708070,Creative Visualization for Beginners,"Summary 1: This book is truly another masterpiece by the master himself, Richard Webster! I have begun reading this book since the day it came out and now, after finishing it, I feel like I have always denied myself of something that I could have used to make my life easier and better. If I would have known about Creative Visualization in my teens, then I know I would have all my dreams realized by now in my 20's. Creative Visualization is something everyone can do and apply it into their everyday life to help realize their dreams and goals! Many fun-filled excercises are included in this book to practice Creative Visualization. As with any Richard Webster book, you will certainly enjoy this one and will not be disappointed!
Summary 2: I have read ""The Secret"" and ""The Law of Attraction"", both great books.I LOVED this book because it presented and explained creative visualization as a practical and relatively easy thing to do each day without all of the drama of the first 2 books I read. We are all visualizing all day, why not direct it towards what we want from our lives instead of having our thoughts bouncing around aimlessly? The book explained how most successful people, such as Tiger Woods, visualize what they want to happen, and then act. Your brain reacts the same when thinking about what you want to happen as it does when you're actually doing, so harness your thoughts to make your life what you want it to be!
Summary 3: I love this book because it allowed me to see just how much I have been limiting myself. I enjoyed learning the techniques to achieving your visualizations. The author makes valid points and talked about many specific subjects that I have been questioning recently and even experiencing, so that has helped me directly address the issues. Overall, I'd hiiighly recommend
Summary 4: Just received this book today 11/23/11, will get to reading it over the holiday, since school is closed and I need something interesting to read. The notes in the book will help me to decide on new ideas for the coming year. Thanks."

Summary 4: Reading this book I recalled the underlying tension at my undergrad university where the Sociology & Psychology departments where in ajoining buildings. The author seems to have an interest in ursurping a dominant role for Soc in defining the world, its spinnings and actors.That said - it is a good casual overview of sociology and sociological thinking. Reading it as a Grad student having been away from academic sociology for 20 years - this is a good brush-up.I do find some passages overly literary pushing metaphors that only confuse me."
0151000891,"Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love : The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin, 1937-1939 (Vol 4)","Summary 1: This unexpurgated volume of Anais Nin's diary contains entries from March 4, 1937 to October 23, 1939. The preface by Rupert Pole (her Los Angeles widower, as opposed to the late Hugh Guiler, her New York widower) notes, ""Toward the end of her life Anais and I discussed the original diaries, and she asked me to publish all her diaries just as she wrote them.""Having now read four volumes of the unexpurgated diary, it is my educated opinion that this was _not_ a good idea. It is unfortunate that Pole has dutifully released this volume of material in this form. It's like he published the first draft of a book--there is so much dross among the gold that I often felt that I was not so much reading as doing penance. It is apparent now that not all the material cut from the expurgated volumes was eliminated because of its scandalousness. If we have learned anything after the sexual revolution, surely it is that even the salacious can be dull.And yet. And yet. Amidst Nin's whiny posturing, her mechanical proclamations of audacity and innocence, nestle passages of such power and beauty (especially starting in 1938) that this volume intermittently becomes riveting. There are also a number of entries where Nin drops her self-glorifying posturing and looks at her own behavior with clear and unflinching eyes. For the first time, for example, I began to understand what she saw in Gonzalo, something that was a mystery to me even from the previous unexpurgated volumes. She becomes enormously likeable when she appears to be displaying some candor.I regard it as truly unfortunate that this book is unlikely to have many readers owing to its lack of editorial discipline. Be patient with it, but be prepared to skim, and don't read it as an introduction to Nin's work.
Summary 2: Some of the readers who have reviewed this book have criticized it as not being up to the level of its predecessors. I think they mean it's not as steamy. Face it, the woman was getting a bit older, calmer, and more mature. She was losing the feverish intensity of her youth. But the beauty of the Anais Diaries, other than the view they give of this brilliant, underappreciated author is that they offer an in-depth look at an entire life, starting when she was a by turns dreamy and extremely practical 11-year old girl, longing for her father and being a good girl, through her twenties and thirties when she had the courage to try everything and the sense to lie about it brilliantly.I wish the editors had gone on and done the ""personal"" versions of her later diaries, as I'm just prurient enough that I'd like to have known what her love life was like in middle and early old age. But the later diaries show a woman who had achieved her ambitions and peace with herself.I'll be honest here. I love Anais Nin. I'll be more honest; I am IN love with Anais Nin. Reading all of these diaries is my greatest literary adventure since discovering Carlos Castaneda in 1975. An in depth reading of the diaries is one of the most profound learning experiences a reader can find. If you want to go on with it you can read Henry Miller, and Proust and all the books that influenced her. You could make a life out of it.I think though it would be better to live one. That is her lesson; live your own life, not the canned life the society wants to sell you.
Summary 3: This is the last, so far published, of the Anas Nin's Unexpurgated diaries, edited by her second (bigamous) husband Rupert Pole, after her death and that of nearly everyone else discussed. The intensity of her love life continues. Her style continues to evolve to more emotion, sensation and thought brought up from the subconscious, and less external facts. This was partly due to the influence of psychoanalysis and Surrealism.She, ahead of most women, was involved in the change of role from helping men to working independently. This was aggravated by her fear of abandonment, left from the early loss of her father. She was in conflict between her own ambition and the fear of losing her men if she competed successfully with them. She was starting to succeed with her own fiction at this time, but her greatest literary success was still her contribution, in every possible way, to Henry Miller's work. This book itself is among her best works and probably of more lasting value than Henry's work, but not in a form that could be published during her life time.Her conflicts and neuroses contribute to the unique value of these books. The emotional scars left by her father contribute to the complexity of her love life and to her difficult but intense and semi-promiscuous sex life. Her partially liberated role and her dependence on the diary for emotional support made it difficult for her to convert from diary writing to fiction, resulting in writing more real and candid than possible when writing for publication. She was in contact with other leading artists of her time, sometimes physically as well as intellectually, and was completely devoted to her relationships and her writing, but most of her writing was so personal that she showed only small sections of it even to her lovers.Her first works to become popular were her erotic stories, written a few years later. These are unusual and perhaps unique as the first serious erotic literature in English and as the first erotica written by a woman. They therefore revealed aspects of sexuality and particularly of female sexuality that were not previously available in writing. Most of that material, as well as her other fiction, was taken directly from these diaries, where it appears more realistically (or surrealistically), in more detail and in its real context.More can be found at: [...]
Summary 4: nearer the moon is a book whic has affected my life in so many good ways. I have become a better lyricist, and a more insightful poet because of her ability to be so bold, honest, and real while being one of the greatist poets and writers of our time. Anais Nin's writting not only stands asa representation of how beautiful life is, but also stands as a bench mark in history. We can look into our past and see when her writing was rejected from culture and society, and see how far we've come. Through Anais Nin we can actully see Americas liberation process."
B000N755OG,Transforming Power: Biblical Strategies for Making a Difference in Your Community,"Summary 1: Transforming Power is Linthicum's challenge to the Evangelical World to be smart about power - not the smoke and mirrors power of politics, which he hardly mentions, but the real, daily life power of bringing positive change to neighborhoods and cities. Starting with a solid biblical theology of society, with its spiritual, cultural, economical and political strands, Linthicum then moves to a description of God's intentions for the world. His discussion of the shalom community will not be new to frequent urbana.org readers, but he manages to bring freshness to the topic.Linthicum's core message is what he calls the ""Iron Rule of Power"": never do for others what they can do for themselves. This notion, honed over decades of community organizing, means simply: don't create dependencies. Linthicum's case study is Nehemiah, who managed to enlist the residents of a decimated Jerusalem in the rebuilding of its walls.Moving to the New Testament, Linthicum discusses the difference between relational power, legislative power, and violent power. The former is the greatest, because it is the longest lasting, and the most effective. It is also the power wielded by Jesus to the tremendous frustration of the wielders of legislative power in his day. In the same way, Christians need to be great stewards of their relationships, in order to most effectively distribute God's empowerment among his church.Transforming Power is both a theoretical book and a practical book and is well worth the read. While it could have used a bit more discussion of spiritual realities and strongholds, the book should provide a powerful biblical framework for our use of, rather than our flight from, power.
Summary 2: The book is an inspiring, practical Biblically-based manual for moving fromcharity to transformation of community. It is enriched by practical examplesfrom real life experiences in low income communities and working with people with soundtheological underpinnings. It is inspiring;one feels hopeful and notdependent on experts, but that transformation, step by step, can happenwith committed people inspired by hope and small first successes. A mustbook for people working in low income communities, especially with faithconnections.
Summary 3: Transforming Power was a great help to me in my understanding of systems and of the necessity of utilizing power to make systemic change. The foundation for this book is that power, when used correctly, is strengthening and liberating. It is critical that Christians understand power and use it in such a way that gives people a purpose, direction, and joy which sets them free.After reading Linthicum's view that Christians are often afraid of power and see having power as a negative and ""un-Christian-like"" it occurred to me just how much this has affected the role the church is playing in today's society. A common belief is that Jesus was gentle and did not want or utilize power. While it is true that Jesus was gentle and loving, it is also true that He used power to fight injustice and saw it as a powerful tool. As Christ followers we need not to be afraid to utilize healthy power in order to bring about a shalom community.There are two major sections of this book, ""Theology of Power"" and the ""Practice of Power."" Linthicum begins with ""Theology of Power"" which lays out a Biblical theology of power giving readers a Biblical framework to place power. He does this by first describing God's desire for a shalom community and then looking at human's destruction of this community.Jesus' use of relational power to triumph over the corrupt and dominating power of the current systems is an example of the positive way in which power can be used. There are many Biblical examples of relational power being used in a positive way by the early church and by the apostles.Linthicum gives practical principles and strategies for utilizing power that brings about transformation. It is the work of the church to learn the Biblical examples of using power and apply it to our world today.I would give this book a rating of five starts. It introduces the reader to Biblical narrative that is often overlooked and incites the reader to action. This book is an easy read that is very powerful. The descriptions of systems by Linthicum were clear and easy to understand. I have already used a number of his Biblical references and power practices in my ministry since reading this book. I know that I will be able to use the theology of this book in many situations during my ministry.
Summary 4: This is an outstanding piece--it should be far more widely read than the attention it has received."
0226965287,Fires (Phoenix Fiction),"Summary 1: Love is a punishment, says Yourcenar, and in some intellectual and emotive way this book is one. I've read all of her books, and this is her most felt, chirurgically precise, passionate and torn aproach to what love is and represents in all the roles we - human beings - play at one time or another in our lives. All the possible deceptions, miscommunications and broken hearts are hold in these pages, through the reconstruction and modernization of some greek myths such as Antigone, Achilles and Patroclus, Sapho, and Maria Magdalena (ok, she was not greek!). Along with &quot;Memoires of Adrian&quot; and &quot;Zenon&quot;, this is a must-have from Yourcenar.
Summary 2: ""Fires"" is a collection of hybrid love stories. Most are taken from real or mythological ancient Greece. Ms. Yourcenar does a spectacular job giving these old stories a modern flavor without losing their original context. I also recommend ""A Blue Tale & Other Stories"" by her{The University of Chicago Press}.Go where the love is. Although in some remote cases it can be a struggle (i.e. Romeo & Juliet; Hamlet), love deserves to be accessible, humane, and democratic. Be not afraid to Love/Live.
Summary 3: this is a rare book in english. I am always shocked to see how hard it is to find it and how no librarian knows Marguerite Yourcenar which is so big in Europe.. so I was glad to find two copies here, one of which i bought used from a third party.good quality, very cheap price.I highly recommend this book, though you'll need to be indulgent with its decadent romantic philosophy of love. it's just like fire."
0062503006,"Stories of the Spirit, Stories of the Heart: Parables of the Spiritual Path from Around the World","Summary 1: This book has story after story of the most incredible spiritual messages passed down by the centuries from Christian, Buddist, and Sufi monks; Jewish Rabbis; Native Americans; etc....I have over 13 years of following a spiritual path and if I ever had to choose one book for &quot;to the point&quot; and direct spiritual nourishment, I'd choose this book.
Summary 2: A friend gave this book to me, and it was as much a part of her dear empathic self as the truth within its'pages. Full of touching stories and simple truths, this book will open your heart and challenge your limits in the depthless wonder of understanding that we are all on our own seperate paths, yet on the same path, here on the trail of life. This book should be in re-print NOW!!
Summary 3: A book of much more depth than the &quot;Chicken Soup&quot; books, though it has something of the same purpose.
Summary 4: this book is one of the most encouraging signs (conveyers?) of health and wisdom in our species. it seems to me ironic that it would go out of print, supplanted by what i remember to be a distinctly less deep and compelling compilationSoul Food: Stories to Nourish the Spirit and the Heart. not that the latter is bad, but the former is so much more outstanding - really a cut above.maybe that's the key - like real learning and growth, you have to work to find it... oy. :-)i recommend them both, but strongly prefer _Stories of the Spirit, Stories of the Heart_, and recommend finding a used copy - they've been available for a good while.
Summary 5: this is a beautiful book. the one i had for years got compromised by the mold damage we had in our old home so had to be thrown out. since this was one of my favourite books -- of course i had to get another one."
0891457062,Victorian Trade Cards: Historical Reference & Value Guide,"Summary 1: Vastly illustrated and very informative. Although the majority of this book is pictures (very nice ones at that), there are some very interesting facts and historical information about the victorian card craze. Because there are in excess of 100,000 different cards in existance, don't expect to find every card in here or the current market price. It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the &quot;Exploration and Travel&quot; chapter instead of the &quot;Tobbaco&quot; chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?).
Summary 2: The beautiful 224 page, 8 1/2 x 11&quot; softbound book contains more than 500 full color, sharp, large photos. '98 values. There are 70 topics ranging from angels, baseball, dolls, expositions to Uncle Sam, women, wringers and washing. There's plenty of background information on each topic. A useful glossary of terms is provided. A must for tradecard collectors. Fascinating to read and refer to.
Summary 3: This is a great book. It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast. It is crammed with illustrations, broken into categories, and contains history and collecting tips. The pricing information is somewhat out of date, due to the impact that online auctions have had on these collectables (some are more expensive, some less, as auctions make them more available.) If you're at all a fan of this genre, don't hesitate to buy this book!
Summary 4: A wonderfully written book on the topic of Victorian trade cards. Information is given on the history of the cards as well as many examples. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in collecting or just want to know more about Victorian cards."
B0006AUIA6,The Masters and the Slaves (Casa-Grande & Senzala): A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization,"Summary 1: Freyre's Masters and Slaves forms what is considered by many to be a trilogy of books published in the 1930's that revolutionized Brazilian Studies. The other are two books,[by other authors]... Freyre, the most popular and readable of the three, was a Pernambucano (from the sugar cane regions around Recife) and often blurs the distinction between Brazil as a whole and sugar-cane regions of Brazil. His methodology reflects his education, a US oriented 1930's anthropological perspective (he was a student of Franz Boas). This book in particular treats a very specific historical event: the development of a sugar-based agricultural economy in late 1500s, early 1600s in northeastern coastal Brazil. The book makes the generalization that Brazilian culture as a whole evolved from this cultural base, and places little importance on the parallel development of cattle-based cultures in the northeastern interior or the primitive jungle trading activities of Sao Paulo's city fathers (Raposo Tavares, etc).Because of its focus on a very provincial-specific economy and culture, I would criticize Freyre for offering a very incomplete study of ""Brazilian Civilization"" in this book. In his defense, however, this book is too often read as a stand-alone study, when in fact Freyre intended for it to form a trilogy with another two books...The former traces how the rural sugar-based culture of early northeastern Brazil affected and was affected by the emergence of cities and urban life-patterns in places like Recife, Salvador, and Rio de Janeiro in the mid 1600s through the end of the 18th century. The latter book follows the study further, through the independence period and especially the twilight of the Empire, establishment of the Republic in the 188o's. If you read one, I recommend all three books to appreciate Freyre's thesis, that the original sugar-culture that developed and was discussed in Masters and Slaves had a lasting impact on Brazil's evolution as a whole, even in areas and regions where sugar cane and slavery were never established bases for economic development. This vision of Brazil remains incomplete without an understanding of Sao Paulo and the south, a region which today is arguably the strongest center of influence in the country. To complete that, I would recommend some books by [other authors]
Summary 2: Gilberto Freyre is now considered one of the grestest thinkers of Brazil, alongside S&eacute;rgio Buarque de Hollanda. As mrs. Laidman recognized, we can't look for his work as if it's been written yesterday: when many people all over Americas (both North and South) believed that &quot;whitening population&quot; was the solution to all problems; when fascists and nazis took power in Europe, Freyre looked at mixture of races and saw it as a positive feature, something that could lead our people to a better place, God knows where, but better. During the 60's and 70's his ideas were fiercely attacked by new generations of sociologists and historians - and that's good, that's how science advances. But, they attacked him, mostly, for his political positions. Today, people rediscovered Freyre, understood him on his own time. Yes, his presumptions about sex addicted people, indian women burning in desire and so on are considered today too much. But the essence, the mix of races and cultures as a positive fact, the understanding of Portuguese government as something absent and masters of plantions, on the absence of State, rulling their slaves and families and regions, masters as the actual power in colonial Brazil, is considered a remarkable way to understand our country and it's people. By the way, many people in Black Movement also recognizes Freyre and his role in understand Brazil's black influences. Despite his presumptions, Freyre is more up to date than ever.
Summary 3: When Gilberto Freyre first launched this essay, 1933, it revolutioned the way brazilians thought about themselves. Until then, we understood us as a &quot;white nation&quot;, with some black people who, eventually, would disappear. Black people's only importance were as slaves, planting sugar cane or coffee. Freyre brings to History black people's contributions: culturally, genetically. Most of all, underlines that brazilians are a mix of cultures and races, not a pure race, and it is a positive feature for as all.
Summary 4: Freyre did extensive research for &quot;The Masters and the Slaves, A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization&quot;, an informative and stimulating social history of Brazil. However, not all of what is written should be taken at face value.The book was written more than 50 years ago and Freyre, like any other historian or ethnologist, unavoidably comes to the table with cultural and personal biases transparent to himself.Freyre makes a number of presumptions, sometimes contradictory, sometimes a bit absurd from today's perspective, about the sexual attributes, habits and dispositions of the Amerindians, peoples of African descent and the Portuguese. Portuguese men are categorized as oversexed (over and over again), Amerindian women as ever willing sexual partners while the Africans are determined to be less sexual because they use music and dancing to stimulate their sexual urges (!). Then, just to confuse the reader, Freyre talks about Africans escaping to the Brazilian bush and `raping' the (ever willing?) Amerindian woman. Did these alleged rapists bring their drummers with them? All three groups can step forward and take offense at Freyre's presumptions.In the year 2000 we would interpret Freyre's presumptions as racist, but we have the benefit of hindsight and he didn't. In his time he would have been considered forward looking and anything but a racist. The reader needs to take note of the author's presumptions, biases and preoccupations and then continue reading. All things considered, this is a remarkable and valuable piece of scholarship.
Summary 5: This is the Second English-Language Edition, revised and with an extended new Preface, of Gilberto Freyre's masterwork, Casa-Grande & Senzala.With astonishing erudition, a commanding sense of style, and a gift for gripping narrative, Senhor Freyre has applied all the modern techniques of social study to the remarkably successful melting-pot culture of ""medieval"" Brazil. He deals with race, climate, agronomy, sexual habits, architecture, the arts, religion, sorcery, literature, history, food, economics, politics, and the thousand other forces that made the Brazil of today what it is. In doing so, he throws blinding light into the color problem, the meanings of ""civiliation"" and ""culture,"" the political and economic situation in Latin America, the significance of ethnolocical and anthropological judgments, etc. From beginning to end The Masters and the Slaves (the Portuguese title literally means Big House and Slave Quarters) is absorbing, colorful, and dense with material. It has the qualities of great literature, not least in that it suggests far more than it states, sends readers' minds on treks and side-trips of their own.--- excerpt from book's dustjacket
Summary 6: It ws very easy to buy and the book arrived in my house in perfect conditions. Everything was fine on it."
B000PWY33S,Economics & the Public Purpose,"Summary 1: This was part of a trilogy that began with *The Affluent Society* (1957), and continued with *The New Industrial State* (1967). However, as Galbraith readily concedes, he learned a great deal in the intervals between writing these books. In 1958, Galbraith's political career was on an upward trajectory; by 1967 he had ruptured with Pres. Johnson over the Vietnam War, and in 1974 he had become reconciled to life in the political and academic wilderness.For strangers to Galbraith's views, it is necessary to understand that he was first and foremost a student of what was, rather than idealized systems. Hence, many of his critics, faced with a dualistic world view, will accuse him of favoring a command economy, on the grounds that he was critical of the pretensions of capitalist economies. I hope readers will immediately see the error of this way of thinking: a clear-sighted analysis of a system that embraces the whole of a society's transactions cannot possibly be reduced to a dualistic judgment.Second, Galbraith was an institutionalist. While orthodox schools of economics tend to emphasize the inherent, automatic nature of all economic transactions regardless of the nature of the agents, institutionalists such as T. Veblen, J. Commons, C. Ayres, and Galbraith identify the economic agents--viz., institutions in the society--as the decisive factor. Galbraith frequently aroused a lot of ire by pointing out the shortcomings of a social science (economics) being dominated by political demagogues, although he preferred to say this using dry wit.In this book, he unites several concepts into an explanatory system. One of these is the concept of the ""convenient social virtue,"" the tendency of people to profusely admire traits in other people they are not prepared to compensate; hence, the admiration of workers whose sense of duty and self-sacrifice transcends any rational economic explanation. He applies this analysis to women, who remain an undercompensated cadre of the workforce. Another concept is that of ""the market system"" as distinct from the ""planning system""; usually economists and demagogues speak of the public sector [bad] versus the private sector [good], as if there were nothing but kinship between the multinational corporation and the corner espresso cart.Galbraith explains that, while the giant industrial firm has very different needs and wants from small shops, it is likely to be very closely aligned to the needs and wants of those holding political power. Hence, the boundary between public and private sectors is less meaningful than that between the planning and the market systems. While the market system is admired, it is also punished with far greater danger and with ""self-exploitation"" by desperate proprietors.The illusion that we live in an economy that is a free market, with an adversarial relationship to the state, is a dangerous one. First, it leads to people assuming that problems of waste and unemployment will solve themselves once an obvious regulatory obstacle is removed. In reality, we live in a planned economy ridden by systems of price controls and monopoly, and that planning is designed to serve industrial management. Assuming the opposite, of course, will only make such problems worse.Second, it is dangerous because we overlook the influence of the planning system on the basic purpose of the state. The insistence of economist-demagogues is that the state is miraculously devoted to the toiling masses, and intent on expropriating the creative fountainhead, John Galt and Henry Reardon. Militarism is assumed to be therefore a rational response to a genuine foreign threat; whereas if the influence is understood to be symmetric, or even understood to flow the other direction, then one will expect militarism to serve the planning system and one will be skeptical of it.There's a lot more in this book, and I believe it deserves a far better review than I've supplied. But I hope this gives a taste of the issues that Galbraith addresses.
Summary 2: In this excellent book, Galbraith examines the economics profession's claim that the current economic system reflects the individual's free choices. For example, the leading orthodox economist Paul Samuelson defines economics as ""How ... we choose to use scarce productive resources with alternative uses, to meet prescribed ends ...""Galbraith comments, ""the imagery of choice ... means that this choosing - this decision to purchase this product, reject that - is what, when aggregated, controls the economic system. And if choice by the public is the source of power, the organisations that comprise the economic system cannot have power. They are merely instruments in the ultimate service of that choice."" So if the consumer has the power, she, not the firm, is to blame for the firm's products or results (e.g. pollution). In theory, the market uses power for the public good; in fact, large corporations use this power for their own purposes.He sums up, ""economics ... also serves the controlling economic interest."" Mainstream economics is a system of ideas that diverts all attacks into channels that are safely futileIn analysing the US economy, Galbraith oddly distinguishes what he calls the `planning system' from the market system. The `planning system' is composed of the thousand giant firms that run the show. The market system is composed of the roughly twelve millions of small businesses.What does the US economic system produce? ""Unequal development, inequality, frivolous and erratic innovation, environmental assault, indifference to personality, power over the state, inflation, failure in inter-industry coordination are part of the system."" He shows how mergers usually produce worse performance, higher rewards for executives and job losses for the workers. ""On no conclusion is this book more clear: left to themselves, economic forces do not work out for the best except perhaps for the powerful.""Galbraith says that the public must take power away from the corporations and use it to plan the economy. He urges us to take responsibility for our society.
Summary 3: John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was a Canadian-American economist, who taught at Harvard University, served as U.S. Ambassador to India (1961-1963), and wrote a number of bestselling books, such asAmerican Capitalism,The Affluent Society (A Mentor Book),The New Industrial State (James Madison Library in American Politics),The Great Crash 1929,The Age of Uncertainty(which was a TV series on the BBC), etc.He wrote in the Foreword to this 1973 book, ""This book is in descent, the last in the line, from two earlier volumes---'The Affluent Society' and 'The New Industrial State.' There are also some genes, though not many, from ... 'American Capitalism.' ... The earlier volumes were centrally concerned with the world of the great corporations... There is also the world of the farmer, repairman, retailer, small manufacturer... This book seeks to bring them fully into the scene... This (book also) gives the first elements of the international scene.""He begins with the observation that not only does General Motors exist to serve the public, but ""General Motors also serves itself."" (Pg. 3) He asserts that no innovation of importance originates with the individual farmer. ""Were it not for the government and farm equipment and chemical firms, agriculture would be technologically stagnant."" (Pg. 48)He notes that the market system is subordinate to the planning system, which supplies power, fuel, machinery, transportation, communications, etc. He then contrasts the ""relatively secure and favorable income for participants in the planning system"" versus a ""less secure and less favorable return for those in the market system."" (Pg. 50) He suggests that the growth in acquisitions of one firm by another is motivated less by monetary rewards, than by the ""prestige"" of ""not a greater rate of return but a greater size."" (Pg. 101)The technostructure thus favors a policy that keeps prices under control, and then serves its affirmative interest in the growth of the firm. (Pg. 115) Galbraith invents the term ""Bureaucratic Symbiosis"" for the tendency of public and private organizations to ""find and pursue a common purpose."" (Pg. 139) He asserts that the small businessman and farmer are ""extremely vulnerable to adversity emanating from the planning system."" (Pg. 177)He concludes that ""the economy must be managed""; but not one economy, but two: ""one that is subject to the market and one that is planned by its constituent firms."" (Pg. 214) He proposes that conversion of ""the fully mature corporations... into public corporations."" (Pg. 261)Not as innovative or thought-provoking as the earlier three volumes, this book nevertheless represents an important continuation in the development of Galbraith's thought."
0440524059,Evidence Never Lies,"Summary 1: After spending literally thousands of hours reading true crime books, I can say that this is the real thing. I was absolutely thrilled to see that it is available because I am going to make it required reading for the students in my Criminal Investigation classes! They may grumble at first about having another book to read, but when they start on &quot;The Evidence Never Lies&quot;, they'll not want to put it down!
Summary 2: As the spouse of an award-winning crime reporter, we found &quot;The Evidence Never Lies&quot; to be a compelling, thought-provoking analysis of the incredible career of Herbert MacDonell. For those whose careers focus on crime, crime buffs, and seekers of great reading, this is a must-buy.
Summary 3: I had to use this book for a forensic science class that I took. This usually means the book will be boring. However, it is very interesting. The cases and all of the facts are set out in detail, and it makes you think. Thinking this way is good practice for anyone interested in criminal justice.
Summary 4: I knew Herb before he investigated the cases discussed in his book, while we were working at Corning Glass. I was unaware of his investigations until after he left Corning and became a professor of criminology at Corning Community College. In the 80's I took his night school class ""An Evening Wasted with Herb MacDonnell"" where, among others, he discussed the cases in this well-written book. If you have not read this book yet, I highly recommend it. A previous review says it's a book you will not want to put down. I completely agree.
Summary 5: Jeff did a beautiful job explaining every detail above and beyond this trial. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book which he wrote from The Heart.

B000MC13J8,Six Bridges,"Summary 1: &quot;Six Bridges - The Legacy of Othmar H. Ammann by Darl Rastorfer is a very well written book about a great 20th Century engineer and his engineering feats in long span suspension bridges. This is a must read for everyone for it reveals the trials and tribulations of a man who made history by using scientific principles to design world record breaking bridges.With his European education Ammann sought out a dream to come to America and seek opportunities in the new country. Within two weeks he started his first position. The early years of Othmar Ammann's career are clearly outlined showing how he gained his knowledge with diligence in various career positions. His thoroughness and dedication to hard work is demonstrated by the trust, faith and confidence of the people who hired him. His reputation was building.I enjoyed the stories which tell of his character building during hard times also. After his plans for a bridge challenged his future with an employer, he was able to move on and demonstrate his convictions with successful accomplishments. Interesting political considerations are also profiled in the important decisions of costly construction and pressures from public opinion. Ammann's skill to work with people results in many obstacles being overcome.When the trials and tribulations of office competition evoled, Ammann had the fortitude to break away and start anew. He was a man of visions and had dreams to fulfill. He was a man of principles and nothing could sway him. He was confident his engineering background and skills could lay a path of successful bridge design and construction.No other bridge engineer has influenced one city more than O.H. Ammann. The history of the planning stages of the designing and construction of these six bridges is well written and interesting for all readers. These six bridges: Georg Washington, Bayonne, Triborough, Bronx-Whitestone, Throngs Neck, and Verrazano-Narrows all are beautifully photographed. A chapter for each bridge outlines their construction with great description and many breathtaking photographs. If you have never been to New York Ctiy this author will certainly take you there with beautiful photos and interesting, informative narrative. Another book including O.H. Ammann's life is: Henry Petrosky's - &quot;Engineers of Dreams: Great Bridge Builders&quot;e-mail &lt;sparty@pathwaynet.com&gt;
Summary 2: During the first half of this century, American bridges became the largest and most beautiful structures ever built; Othmar Ammann, a Swiss engineer who came to New York in 1904, was the quiet genius who built six of the very best.George Washington, Bayonne, Triborough, Bronx-Whitestone, Throgs Neck and Verrazano-Narrows are his monuments; like the skyscrapers, literally ""invented"" in New York, the builders of suspension bridges perfected their art in the US. It shows what can be accomplished with new wealth, pride and vision. One of the finest is the Verrazano-Narrows bridge; the towers for the cables are as high as a seventy story building. To put this in perspective, that's twice as high as the tallest ""skyscraper"" in Phoenix.Each tower was assembled with 10,000 steel cells, fastened with six million rivets and two million bolts. The Empire State Building has 365,000 tons of steel, the bridge has 1,265,000 tons. Like the Parthenon, where the pillars were sculpted to present the most pleasing appearance, the bridge towers are tapered from top to bottom. The two towers are plumb, but the curvature of the earth means the tops are one and five-eighth inches further apart than the base. Since metal expands in hot weather, the roadway at the center of the span rises or falls by 12 feet during a temperature change of 100 degrees.Bigger bridges will be built. Some will be more beautiful. But these six are the ones that set the standard. Everything from now will be an adaptation of them. It's like the Golden Age of radio, or television, or movies, or the Internet; experimentation and innovation is always greatest when technology is new.A suspension bridge is truly an artistic sculpture, because it is based on natural curve of a cord strung between two points. Look at a spider's web, the curve of a bird's wing, or wheat bending in the wind; there is a contrast between nature and the massive stone blocks of earlier bridges. The book is admirably illustrated with more than 200 photos; they show the artistry, and the incredible labor that went into the construction of each.In today's society, when lowest cost seems to be the only consideration, some wisdom from Ammann in 1958 stands out, ""In fact, an engineer designing a bridge is justified in making a more expensive design for beauty's sake. After all, many people will have to look at the bridge for the rest of their lives. Few of us appreciate eyesores, even if we should save a little money by building them.""It shows good design is possible, and adds a great deal to a community. Like Will Bruder's design of the new Phoenix library, skillfully described in the book &quot;Phoenix Central Library&quot; by Oscar Riera Ojeda, et al, this book is a must for anyone interested in better communities.
Summary 3: This is the first to examine the works of Ammann, one of the finest modern bridge designers of modern times. This uses over 200 archival photos to present displays of his New York bridges, their construction, and the development of his ideas. The in-depth details on bridge designs of the times and Ammann's place in the world of bridge designers makes for excellent coverage.Diane C. Donovan Reviewer
Summary 4: I'd like to take this opportunity to ""thank"" Othmar Ammann for creating the main object in my worst nightmare - The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (the nightmare involves getting a flat tire while traveling the upper deck). It's good to face your fears and Darl Rastorfer's fine book ""Six Bridges: The Legacy of Othmar H. Ammann"" enabled me to face mine in the least threatening way possible. The book would be an excellent addition to any coffee table or a keeper in the car for when you're getting a tire replaced.""Six Bridges"" is actually a concise history of bridge building in the United States with no shortage of drama including Ammann's investigative leadership of the Tacoma (Washington) Narrows collapse, which still ripples through the civil engineering world today.Swiss-born Ammann became the greatest long suspension bridge designer and master craftsman. Rastorfer uses Swiss-like economy in taking us through the engineer's four-decade career from his first design submission for the George Washington Bridge in 1924 to the opening of the Verrazano in 1964. We learn that Ammann wanted to return to Switzerland more than once but destiny repeatedly intervened with project challenges growing in tandem with his reputation.The author neatly rivets together personal and technical information, creating a sturdy and handsome edifice. Nuances showing in the personal demonstrate Ammann's deep-seated entrepreneurship including parting ways with mentor Gustav Lindenthal when Lindenthal refused to climb down off his giantism in contemplating a Hudson River crossing. Ammann's close relationship with New Jersey Gov. George Silzer gave the engineer courage to break with Lindenthal, Rastorfer notes (p. 25). Another ally and collaborator was the main character of the book ""Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York."" Lots of nuance to pick through in that fellow's legacy.Ammann joined the Port Authority of New York in 1925, the year he became a U.S. citizen. Offspring from that period include the Bayonne Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel. Years before the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey got its official name it existed in the person of Othmar Ammann.Interesting that Ammann's early career was spent connecting New York and New Jersey and his later works involved better connecting parts of New York City. Logically, you would have expected the reverse. Not surprising at all upon learning what bridge building, the auto industry and that ""Power Broker"" guy with his highways created in the Five Boroughs after World War II. ""Build it and they will come"" comes to mind.The Verrazano-Narrows is just as likely to confound sociologists as civil engineers. After his ""muscular"" Throgs Neck Bridge triumph, what did Ammann have left to prove? Rastorfer nails it using the engineer's own words - to create ""an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible"" (p. 138). We come to learn that the Empire State Building is a toothpick compared to the long-span Louisville Slugger hewn by Ammann. New York should be called The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge State but that doesn't fit on a license plate.Our author scales the heights through compelling photos and prose summarizing the 12-year effort. We meet Hard Nose Murphy and the fearless ""Boomers."" My conservative nose got rankled by the demolition that forever changed Bay Ridge, Brooklyn (might as well call it ""Bay Bridge"" now) and management stalling on putting up netting after three workers fell to their deaths. Netting went up after unionized workers walked off the job (wonder if that would happen today) and four workers were saved by the netting. As Gay Talese does in his book ""The Bridge,"" Rastorfer enables the back-stage heroes to take a bow.Ammann must have been grateful for G-d creating men able to laugh in the face of vertigo. The crewmen must have been glad for a master craftsman that used each project to create another world engineering benchmark. Rastorfer has recorded their achievements, which some of us drive by or on unthinkingly every day, in such a memorable way.Hopefully, the 65th anniversary of the creation of Ammann & Whitney, Consulting Engineers (which occurred when Ammann and partner C.C. Combs joined forces with reinforced concrete design pioneer Charles Whitney) will be marked in some way this year. When that occurs we should reexamine the pillars of Ammann's work - shining like the towers of one of his bridges. Like an Ammann design both will surprise upon close inspection - 1) Bridge engineering is NOT an exact science (p. 38) and 2) ""It is a crime to build an ugly bridge"" (p. 35). Given these, how was Ammann able to create an unbroken chain of success? See the end of Chapter 1 for the master craftsman's humble and surprising answer."
B000R1M8VG,El Senor de las Moscas,"Summary 1: El Se&ntilde;or de las Moscas William Golding La isla desierta, el segundo comienzo de la humanidad, la juventud e inexperiencia de sus ocupantes, la relajaci&oacute;n de los controles morales y la gradual ca&iacute;da de sus habitantes en la inercia y la anarqu&iacute;a, estos son los elementos que encontramos en el se&ntilde;or de las moscas. Me pregunto que seria de mi si estuviese en esa situaci&oacute;n, caer&iacute;a en la anarqu&iacute;a o tratar&iacute;a e imitar la decadente sociedad de la que vengo? Aunque estoy de acuerdo con el autor en muchas cosas, no estoy de acuerdo con la premisa de que el mal es innato y que la supresi&oacute;n de los controles provoque caos. Quiz&aacute;s sea yo el menos indicado para se&ntilde;alar esto y solo sea un simple so&ntilde;ador, ya que en mis a&ntilde;os de colegio fui un Piggy cualquiera, blanco de las burlas y las mofas de los m&aacute;s astutos aunque menos intelectuales que yo. Y despu&eacute;s en mi vida adulta como profesor he visto que el egocentrismo de los ni&ntilde;os los lleva a veces a ser crueles con sus compa&ntilde;eros. Pero aun me resisto a creer, deseo firmemente demostrar que ese proceso puede revertirse, aunque veo que por lo visto en los &uacute;ltimos tiempos la violencia infantil en las escuelas por parte de ni&ntilde;os ha aumentado bastante. La novela sin embargo trata el punto de vista del autor que supo expresar sus pensamientos magistralmente, aunque debo decir que las descripciones de la selva me resultaron cansonas. Pero eso ya es culpa m&iacute;a, pues nunca he sido muy adepto a las descripciones de paisajes, siendo atra&iacute;do enormemente en cambio por los aspectos psicol&oacute;gicos de las obras...... Descripci&oacute;n de la obra Esta obra de William Golding es una f&aacute;bula al estilo ingles ( parece ser que a los ingleses les encanta escribir este tipo de f&aacute;bula moralista de mundos en decadencia. Solo tenemos que acordarnos de Un Mundo Feliz, 1984, Hacienda de Animales y otras mas, todas sobre mundos o sociedades en su ocaso o dominados por seres autoritarios) en que un grupo de PRE-adolescentes y ni&ntilde;os se ve atrapado en una isla desierta . Los personajes principales de la obra reflejan cada uno una condici&oacute;n distinta del ser humano. Ralph, el gobernante elegido por el grupo, tiene buenas intenciones, don de mando, y una inteligencia por encima de la mediocridad aunque no siempre tiene las mejores ideas. Se apoya inconscientemente en Piggy y solo al final se da cuenta de que era el &uacute;nico amigo verdadero y el &uacute;nico con visi&oacute;n suficiente para pensar casi como adulto. Piggy representa la inteligencia, no siempre escuchada cuando se mueven otros intereses, a veces solo cuando es demasiado tarde. Jack es el antagonista por excelencia, en busca de poder no escatima en esfuerzos por satisfacer sus ansias de ser un gobernante de la isla y dar rienda suelta a instintos que quiz&aacute;s en un mundo civilizado hubiesen permanecido acallados. Su odio visceral hacia Piggy desde un principio es el odio hacia el sentido com&uacute;n que le impedir&iacute;an dar rienda suelta a sus ambiciones y man&iacute;as. La historia puede prestarse a m&uacute;ltiples interpretaciones, pero creo que la mas clara de ellas es la sombr&iacute;a visi&oacute;n del autor hacia la humanidad en si y de c&oacute;mo el mal es algo innato que surge en el ser humano una vez se han relajado los controles que lo mantienen a raya... Luis M&eacute;ndez
Summary 2: Le&iacute; este libro muy joven, 15 a&ntilde;os. A esa edad fue uno de los que m&aacute;s me impresion&oacute; de todo lo que hab&iacute;a le&iacute;do, y a esa edad hab&iacute;a le&iacute;do mucho: desde Poe, Agatha Christie, Mart&iacute;, y muchos otros. Le&iacute;a sin preferencias.Creo que ahora que tengo el doble de la edad voy a darle una segunda lectura.
Summary 3: &Eacute;sta no es una novela para pasar un rato agradable.En la historia aparecen muchos s&iacute;mbolos o representaciones sobre la sociedad humana y esto puede ser interesante para varios lectores, pero la esencia de la novela es cruda, fuerte, inmisericorde.El hecho de que los protagonistas sean j&oacute;venes no la convierte autom&aacute;ticamente en literatura juvenil. Sugiero leerla antes de recomendarla o regalarla.
Summary 4: Es uno de los mejores libros que se pueden recomendar para pasar un momento totalmente entretenido, y sobre todo para reflexionar acerca de nuestras propias carencias y limites."
0595146023,Head Lock: A Tom Bethany Mystery,"Summary 1: A few weeks ago I came across the Jerome Doolittle book ""Body Scissors""-his first Tom Bethany mystery novel. It is an excellent book and I was impressed by the quality of writing, the attention to detail and the characterization. I then found and bought Doolittle's 4th novel, ""Head Lock,"" expecting more of the same high quality work. What a disappointment! Doolittle, who was a speech writer for former president Jimmy Carter, is still stewing over the fact that Carter was a one-term president. Doolittle's venomous hate for former president Reagan et al was apparently too much to contain, and in ""Head Lock"" he has a political hissy fit. Throughout the novel he heaps abuse and saracasm on Reagan, George Bush, Christians, pro-lifers, L. A. police, Republicans, Conservatives-any and all that he envisions as an enemy of Carter and the True Left. This book is a political temper tantrum masquerading as a novel. And if the abuse Doolittle shovels out isn't enough to turn you off, the ""heroes"" of this book are (a)a prostitute who has murdered two people and repeatedly bedded a teenaged boy; (b)a married mother of two who carries on a steamy affair with the detective hero, while her husband smiles his approval; (c)a detective (Tom Bethany) who breaks a dozen laws to entrap and blackmail a cartoon-character anti-abortion leader. Then, at book's end, Bethany preaches a long, boring sermon to the reader about the efficacy of religious faith vs. good works. What drivel! I give this book one star --- a star because Doolittle has provided us with compelling written evidence showing why Carter (and his aides like Doolittle) were thrown out of the White House after four years.
Summary 2: Though Jerome Doolittle can scorch the souls of Republicans, dishonest businessmen, dopey politicians and a lot of other of folks, he saves his greatest venom for hypocrites.In Head Lock, he finds a good one, a preacher, outspoken opponent of abortion, senatorial wannabe and sexual miscreant.I've been reading several of the Doolittle series featuring the somewhat odd private investigator Tom Bethany in the last few months, and, unfortunately, have read them a little out of order. This is not a fatal mistake; I've just found myself a little confused by the lives of some of Bethany's friends as they leave one career--say, operating a massage parlor, for another, running a religious theme park. That's also not the fault of the author or his sharp writing. Doolittle is a must read for anyone appalled by what passes for political and moral leadership in this day and age. Be prepared for some of Doolittle's zingers, hurled at many people in all of his Bethany books, but thrown with a little extra sting at phony moralizing. Suffice it to say that, in this book, Bethany puts away the bad guy in fine fashion, though not until after he's done irreparable harm to a teenager he doesn't even know. I recommend Doolittle without qualms; someone has to take on the phonies of the world and not be real nice about it in the process.
Summary 3: Once again, Jerome Doolittle is unafraid to take on issues that are controversial. Via Tom Bethany, the non working workaholic, he inserts some thought provoking insights into the heated debate of abortion. Perhaps the most frightening part is the antagonistic characters may be ousted from Jerome's book and placed into the world and we would be able to identify them. Jerome knows how to weave a story and fill it with humor, comraderie, and perhaps even a touch of wishful thinking."
0505524295,Gabriel's Fate,"Summary 1: Pinkerton Agent, Gabriel Caine was hired to find a murderer named Ivo Hardwick and return him to stand trial. He ran into a strange group of fortune tellers along the way. He thought little of it until he stopped one of them, Sophie Madrigal, from killing the very man he was sent to locate! t seemed that Sophie had her heart set on revenge and was determined to relocate and kill Hardwick before Gabriel could drag the villain back to what &lt;>he considered ""Justice""!It dawned on Gabriel that Sophie, Aunt Juniper, and Dmitri had connections and he would quickly locate Hardwick if he stayed close. By doing so, he found out that the group were not a bunch of tricksters, as Sophie wanted him to believe. Sophie and Juniper were real!Sophie wanted only to get rid of Gabriel! No matter how rude she was he refused to leave her alone! Her visions, that seldom happened, increased in his presence. So did her talent. It seemed that Gabriel was a perfect media for her, though she loathed to admit it. And no matter how much she began to like him, she dare not tell him. His fate, according to her talent, was to die during this mission!***** Awesome story! This is one the reader will be reluctant to put down for any length of time! I sure could not! A major recommended read from an author who has proven her talent many times over! *****
Summary 2: In the nineteenth century out west, Sophie Madrigal makes a living by telling fortunes, but her real motive is to bring Ivo Hardwick to frontier justice administered by herself for the murder of her son. Pinkerton undercover agent Gabriel Caine also seeks Ivo, but being a quasi-member of the law he must bring the killer in alive.When Sophie and Gabriel meet on a train, the attraction overwhelms everything else. However, they have nothing in common but the need to find Ivo links the twosome. Still, Sophie's Aunt Juniper decides that it is in the cards for Gabriel and her niece to share a lifetime of love. Using every trick she knows as a spiritualist, Juniper plays matchmaker between two stubborn individuals who fate has deemed belong together.GABRIEL'S FATE is a refreshing western romance because of the inclusion of the occult in the thrilling story line. The plot is action packed, and the strong cast makes this is a fascinating reading experience. The lead couple disagrees on everything, making them an engaging duet, but it is the support ensemble of eccentrics that allow Gabriel and Sophie to shine as they amusingly enable fate to take its ""natural course"" of action. Emma Craig provides the audience with an appealing amusing novel worth reading by sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner
Summary 3: Gabriel Caine was born in a family of revivalists, which he considered in the same light that Emma Craig considers clairvoyants. A strange bond to share, indeed, this disbelief in the gifts and beliefs of one's family. But Emma's prickly and non-trusting nature doesn't allow for men to enter her life, and Gabriel willingly accepts whatever bond he can find. Too bad the only other bond they share is a desire to locate murderer Ivo Hardwick.With his roguish, dark looks, Gabriel's accustomed to women simpering and smirking over him. But Gabriel prefers a challenge, and Emma meets that challenge perfectly. Beneath that haughty exterior, he believes she has character and heart, which he intends to reveal. He also intends to uncover Emma's carefully guarded secret. He knows she intends to kill Hardwick, but he doesn't know why. Further, his under cover assignment to the Pinkerton Agency requires that he bring Hardwick back alive.Emma Craig creates a fascinating and daring blend of spiritualism and the occult in GABRIEL'S FATE. By treating psychic gifts as blessings from God, the spiritual battles of these wounded and disbelieving characters lends strong motivation to the tale. The secondary characters, including a tarot card reading aunt, a Russian midget, and a Chinese pub keep the reader entertained with their antics and audaciousness. In addition, Craig's heroine breaks romantic standards with her concern for extra pounds on a figure the hero considers lush. Consequently, with powerful conflict and strong motivation, GABRIEL'S FATE comes very highly recommended."

0971949018,Call Me Black Call Me Beautiful,"Summary 1: Highly recommended for day-care centers and early-learning centers for story-time. Very helpful to all children especially bi-racial and foreign nationals. Also a great start for the younger children--they understand everything!!!Dr. Henderson..... ""you go, girl""
Summary 2: ""Well, honey, you are black."" Richard looks down at his hands and arms and says matter-of-factly, ""No I'm not. I'm brown.""The social construct of race is a concept ambiguous to many adults, and can be incomprehensible to young children, particularly those of color. Able to accurately identify the Crayola colors in their environment, African American youth are often bewildered when their own chestnut/walnut/pecan/ebony/beige/mahogany/red skin tones are universally referred to as ""black"". And in a society that typically assigns negative connotations to the word ""black"", racial identity becomes even more problematic.Call me Black Call me Beautiful addresses the question of racial identity through Richard, a young African American boy. As the story begins, Richard is portrayed as a happy child with a multiethnic array of peers, both on the soccer field and in the classroom. When Richard's demeanor turns sullen, his concerned mother prods her son for an explanation. It is then that Richard reveals that a white friend, Max, has called him ""black"", a label perplexing to Richard as he stares at his hands and arms, which are clearly brown to him.In simple yet poignant terms, Richard's mother first affirms her son's observations: ""You are my caramel brown baby, Daddy is smooth, dark chocolate brown, and I am honey brown."" She then explains that ""black"" and ""white"" are merely terms to describe groups of people. The story's themes of self love and appreciation for others resound in the mother's advice to Richard: ""So the next time Max calls you black, smile at him with joy. Explain to him that despite your different skin colors, you are both absolutely beautiful!""Central to the story are Jennifer C. Kindert's bold and colorful watercolor illustrations. The characters' skin tones and facial and body features capture the wide array physical characteristics within the African American family. Also captured visually is the ambiguity of race. Indeed, white Max's beige skin tone and facial features closely resemble those of Richard's black great-grandmother, Dorothy. Detailed and synchronized to the plot, the illustrations compliment the text both nicely and appropriately.Children of all ages will benefit from this book, as will parents, teachers, and librarians. The straightforward and conversational writing style allows for easy understanding by all readers. Call Me Black Call Me Beautiful fills a much-needed place in multicultural children's literature. Dr. Henderson translates potentially difficult concepts in a style that is simple and joyful.
Summary 3: I can attest (both professionally and personally) to the many obstacles parents of color face in raising healthy children. The reallity is that there are specific challenges parents of color face in nurturing and guiding our children on a path to success that mainstream children's books simply do not address. Call Me Black Call Me Beautiful makes a vital contribution to children's literature and is an effort that is long overdue.
Summary 4: My 2 year old daughter calls this book: ""Richard."" She loves it. She is just 2 years old, and yet, in this multi-cultural world that we live in, she gravitates towards this book.Can she articulate her vision of race in the world around her? no. Can she have friends of different races, and still be aware that she is black? Yes.This book helps her do so.And we gladly read it over and over and over, any time she asks for ""richard."""

0967149223,A Philadelphia Catholic to King James's Court: Discussion/Study Guide,"Summary 1: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court is an informative, beneficial, and interesting book to read. The plot is based around a 17 year old, Catholic boy named Michael. After the death of his father, he, his mother, and siblings get away from Philadelphia to spend a summer at a relative's house in rural Kentucky. There Michael is faced with many challenges concerning his Catholic faith and beliefs. He becomes involved in many heated biblical debates with local fundamentalist. I found that these debates made the book exciting and it kept me hooked in. Through many instances in the novel, I gained greater knowledge on why Catholics believe in what they do, and on the biblical information to support those beliefs. That made the book very unique. If you are a person questioning the Church's teachings and beliefs, then this novel is a must read.
Summary 2: Martin Deporres Kennedy has a fine gift for storytelling. He pulls you into the story. I read this through in one sitting. The story is a vehicle for introducing theological ideas, often through debates between characters. These debates are very realistic, and may reflect actual arguments that the author haard or participated in. I would strongly recommend this for students. It would be a wonderful thing for Catholic high school religion teachers to assign their class.
Summary 3: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court was an interesting book. Not being Catholic, I saw the book in a different light. The book was a bit boring in the beginning speaking of farms and churches in the country. But it grew from a few differences to a spiritual battle between Les' Church and Michael. The debates towards the end were heated and very valid points presented Michael. However, the antagonists and their opinions were portrayed as ignorant and represented no true Christian views.The book was over all offensive and exemplified the ignorance of the author toward other faiths that aren't Roman Catholic. It gave the reader a disorganized look into the Protestant Religion as a whole, though the author only speaks of Fundamentalists. It seemed vague, unfactual at times, and misrepresented the intended target of the book, Protestants. We do not need books like this that divide our faith but literature to unite us, excluding differences. The legacy of Pope John Paul II actually defies the intentions of this book. His life and death were a testimony to God's calling, to unite Christianity. I truly admire the Catholic faith, but this book seeks to demonize my faith in which I can not appreciate. I wasn't very fond of this book, but it was interesting though I wouldn't recommend it."

It not only gives good basic knowledge, but also includes study and research paths which lead into further light and understanding of our craft in modern aspects.""Black Square and Compass"" also shows the correlation and significance of PHA in association with modern black history. For example accomplishments of the Buffalo Soldiers and the network of the Underground Railroad.

B000OWCT12,FOR LOVE AND MONEY: A Novel of Stocks and Robbers,"Summary 1: She never wanted to be the sole breadwinner in her family, but she finds herself exactly in that position. Her husband never recovered from the destruction of the World Trade center or the betrayal by a friend who sued him for something he never did. Unable to cope, he quit his job as a stockbroker and became a vegetable couch potato. Annie, a stockbroker at the same firm her spouse left, tries to make her income cover their bills as two salaries used to do while allowing her housekeeper to raise their two children.Her boss is coming on to Annie and she is ready to succumb to his charms. As she ponders an affair, her best friend's father accuses Annie of stealing bearer bonds from him and her housekeeper abruptly quits leaving behind two emotionally wrecked children in her wake. Annie realizes she must straighten out her own life, be strong for her daughters, and uncover what happened to the bonds while knowing she cannot truly aid her children or her husband until she helps herself.Leslie Glass displays her wry wit and cutting edge humor in a poignant family drama with a touch of mystery that hooks readers from beginning to end. The protagonist learns that she is strong because circumstances require her to be so; fortified with moral fiber and courage Annie takes charge of her life before she ends up in the same abyss as her husband. He is an intriguing character, her opposite for when the going got tough, he quit. Readers will appreciate this strong tale with a memorable cast who laugh on the outside, but cry on the inside.Harriet Klausner
Summary 2: This book started out really well, and kept my attention throughout, however- Ms. Glass seems to have rushed the ending. The story develops the characters well, and is believable and entertaining. I just thought the climax was rushed. Everything happens in the last chapter, and it just seemed like she wanted to finish the book without finishing the story. I would recommend this book for an easy read.
Summary 3: Annie, a stockbroker, is not just asked but begged to go to to the home of a friends elderly parents,who both seem in the grip of dementia, and remove a lifetime of securities for safekeeping. She reluctantly does so. After bringing them back to her office it is determined that a large block of bearer bonds are missing. Carol's father then demands the securities back.Her husband is suffering from post trumatic stress syndrome having survived the attack on the world trade center. He has since turned into a couch potatCarol, the friend who got her into this mess, is a fantasticdecorator, living in a loveless marriage. Will an affair bring her happiness?The book is a well written view of the neurotic tendenciesof New Yorkers under a lot of stress.
Summary 4: For Love and Money is an entertaining example of ""matron lit,"" one of the latest sub-genres in women's fiction. Protagonist Annie Custer is married, but unhappily so. Her best friend, Carol, is dealing not only with a neglectful husband but forgetful parents who stubbornly refuse to turn over their hoarded stock certificates to the safety of a brokerage account.Now Carol has secured her parents' reluctant agreement and begs Annie, a top-notch stockbroker, to travel to their home and pick up the certificates in person. It's a trip which Annie realizes will take her beyond the boundaries of the strictly ethical and possibly jeopardize her career. As if that weren't enough on her plate, Annie's husband is immobilized by trauma from September 11 plus the loss of his job. Her brilliant older daughter has succumbed to a depression so deep she refuses to start college, or even to get out of bed in the morning, while her younger daughter is probably curling up with a bong full of pot. Is it any wonder that Annie is consoling herself with visions of an afternoon romp with her good-looking boss, Brian?I checked this book out of my local library, where I found it shelved with mysteries and thrillers. There are mysteries to be solved: How have several hundred thousand dollars in bearer bonds gone missing? Is the death of one of the characters really due to natural causes? But the more engrossing questions are whether or not Annie will end up in bed with Brian, whether she will leave her husband and whether her family will fall apart completely when their steadfast housekeeper goes back to South America.The first two mysteries are not wholly solved -- in fact, it's left to the reader's interpretation as to whether or not a murder actually took place. But the dilemmas involving Annie's life are neatly resolved. I agree in part with another reader reviewer who feels that the climax seems rushed. I don't object to an ending that quickly wraps up loose ends per se -- I've been accused of ending novels abruptly myself. So what I find overly abrupt in Glass' ending is not the way the financial mystery is wrapped up but the quickness with which both husband and daughter emerge from their funks. Her husband and daughter both seem to be clinically depressed, a condition which doesn't usually clear up that fast.This is fiction, though, and deftly written and enjoyable fiction at that. I found the book an entertaining read. And I was delighted to discover another novel in the growing collection of ""matron lit,"" both because I'm a mature reader myself and because the protagonist of my latest novel -- probably ten years Annie's senior -- also consoles herself with an unexpected lover during a period of marital discord.That said, I'm glad I didn't pay the hardcover price for a book that can be devoured during the course of a few hours plane trip. I'd wait for the paperback edition."
0879856580,KODAK Photographic Filters Handbook (Kodak Publication),"Summary 1: This book is designed for professional photographers, photo lab technicians and scientists who use filters. The book contains infomation on applications, physical, optical and transmission characteristics. This book is not suitable for amateur photographers wanting to learn about the use of filters to improve their photography. Contains no pictures, its all numbers and graphs.
Summary 2: The title says what it is - handbook on Kodak filters. I got this book because I was interested in creating anaglyphs (the red/cyan 3D images that require the funky glasses to view) and was looking for the best filter combination. Not only did this book provide what I was looking for, but it proved to be an interesting read in itself, and it broadened by understanding of filters.The primary limitation of the book is that it gives technical data only for Kodak-manufactured filters. It includes the colored filters, color correction filters, haze filters, UV filters, safelight filters and neutral density filters. The first part of the book is chapters on various types of filters, and 40+ pages in the back contain transmission vs. wavelength data, both in tabular and graphical form, for all of the Kodak filters. Other tables include spectral-transmittance bar charts, chromaticity diagrams and colorimetric data and a 4 page table to convert between density and percent transmittance.I knew I was buying a book of tables, but was pleasantly surprised by the 90+ pages on filter descriptions, application and technical information. Although a book such as Kodak's USING FILTERS may be an easier and more in-depth read, one can learn quite a bit about filters reading this handbook. Some of the topics discussed are filter manufacturing, storage and handling, filter stability, and color temperature.Although not for a beginning photographer, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to an advanced amateur who wants to know more about filters and how to get the most from them. Of course, pros, labs and scientists definitely should consider having this around. I also felt that it was reasonably priced.
Summary 3: If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this book has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters. The information is simply available no where else in this easy-to-reference format. Be cautioned that this book is not targeted at casual amateur photogs or those learning lab techniques."
0875847897,Teams At the Top,"Summary 1: In one of his several brilliant studies of leadership, Organizing Genius, Warren Bennis examines high-performance teams such as those associated with the Disney studios (which created the first full-length animation film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), the Manhattan Project, Xerox's PARC, and Lockheed's ""Skunk Works."" But if your own organization has few (if any) geniuses, what are the best strategies for unleashing the potential of both collaborative teamwork and individual leadership? Katzenbach is himself the author or co-author of a number of brilliantly conceived and executed studies, notably The Wisdom of Teams and Real Change Leaders. In this book, his central thesis is that ""an integrated balance of real team, individual, and single-leader working group performance is both possible and desirable at the top -- not that one mode is intrinsically better than the other."" The key phrase is ""integrated balance."" Whatever the size and nature of your organization, Katzenbach offers ""three major messages"":1. The best senior leadership groups are rarely a true team at the top -- although they can and do function as real teams when major, unexpected events prompt that behavior.2. Most of the team members can optimize their performance as a group by consciously working to obtain a better balance between their team and non-team efforts -- rather than by trying to become an ongoing single team.3. The secret to better balance lies in learning to integrate the discipline required for team performance with the discipline of executive (single-leader) behavior -- not in replacing one with the other.This third ""message"" is especially relevant to smaller companies, probably privately-owned, in which the CEO (the archetypical single-leader) is either the founder or related to the founder. In such companies, the need for an ""integrated balance"" may be even greater than it is for much larger organizations. Katzenbach organizes his material within nine chapters. Rather than list their titles, I have selected a few key passages which, hopefully, will suggest the potential value of this book to you and your own organization's specific needs and interests.Executive Leadership Discipline requires an individual to ""create and maintain urgency, resolve the critical strategic issues, enforce individual accountability, leverage executive time, make the tough decisions individually, pick the best individuals for the key jobs, and periodically raise the bar."" (Chapter One)""The notion of `leadership capacity' implies a system of leadership, if you will, that can extract leadership wisdom, insight, and behaviors from many more individuals. [This is obviously essential to concensus-building.] Thus it fuels the continuing search for different kinds of leadership approaches, both individual and joint, at all levels of the organization."" (Chapter Three)Team Leadership Discipline requires members to ""create a meaningful purpose, commit to a team performance goals, be mutually accountable (no member can fail... only the team fails), commit to real work, share decision among members, strive for the right skill mix, and establish the height of the bar."" (Chapter Four)""Integrating real team performance with executive leadership performance requires both a sharp understanding of the differences between the two two disciplines required and a relentless determination to integrate the two. It is hard work, counterintuitive, and outside the comfort zone of most senior executives. Nevertheless, it is well worth the effort."" (Chapter Nine)In Appendix B, Katzenbach offers this definition of a real team: ""A small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable."" My own opinion is that unless an organization has the two disciplines (both executive leadership and team leadership) in appropriate balance, it will probably have neither. Hopefully, this brief commentary will encourage you to read and then re-read this important book. Also, to check out the other books authored or co-authored by Katzenbach.
Summary 2: The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?
Summary 3: Like many others, I picked up this book hoping to get a kernel or two of wisdom on how to consult to those at the top of the leadership pyramid. What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a ""real team""; b) encouraging CEOs to create ""real"" executive ""teams"" and c) permitting ""undisciplined"" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior. There is little of value in this lightly-referenced and illogically-written tome. This is not the book to take on a long plane trip as your only reading, unless you are a big fan of command and control leadership styles.
Summary 4: Companies all across the economic spectrum are making use of teams. They go by a variety of names and can be found at all levels. In fact, you are likely to find the group at the very top of an organization professing to be a team. But even in the best of companies, a so-called top team seldom functions as a real team. Jon Katzenbach, states that a team effort at the top can be essential to capturing the highest performance results possible -- when the conditions are right. Good leadership requires differentiating between team and nonteam opportunities, and then acting accordingly.Three litmus tests must be passed for a team at the top to be effective. First, the team must shape collective work products -- these are tangible performance results that the group can achieve working together that surpass what the team members could have achieved working on their own. Second, the leadership role must shift, depending on the task at hand. And third, the team's members must be mutually accountable for the group's results.When these criteria can be met, senior executives should come together to achieve real team performance. When the criteria cannot be met, they should rely on the individual leadership skills that they have honed over the years.
Summary 5: I was hugely disappointed with this book. It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as &quot;amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,&quot; &quot;disrupt the natural order of things,&quot; &quot;seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,&quot; &quot;seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,&quot; &quot;time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,&quot; had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."
B0007J6LKC,Requiem for a Wren,"Summary 1: Nevil Shute's gentle and very clever way of telling a story really shines here. This one sneaks up on you as you slowly find yourself caught up in the emotions of the characters, all of whose lives have been forever shaped and scarred by their experiences in WWII. Masterfully told in partial flashback, the mystery of the suicide of a parlourmaid at an Australian sheep station turns out to have profound implications for everyone involved in her life. A deeply moving and haunting novel, Mr. Shute deftly shows us how ""Like some infernal monster, still venemous in death, a war can go on killing people for a long time after it's all over.""This is a stunning novel by a master storyteller. Highly recommended.NOTE: This is also published as 'The Breaking Wave'
Summary 2: I have recently discovered Nevil Shute, and what a find! I highly recommend this book. It's a story that takes place during WWII when a man returns home to australia to find that his parents' parlor maid has committed suicide. As he searches for her identity he reminisces about the war and the people he met.
Summary 3: Someone dubbed Nevil Shute ""the Prince of Storytellers"" and it's not just hype. He wrote about 20 novels between 1930 and 1960, all of which are good and a few of which are great (""Trustee from the Toolroom, ""A Town Like Alice"" and ""On the Beach""). Many of Shute's books, like ""Requiem for a Wren,"" revolve around individuals caught up in the trauma of World War II or the post-war world. Many take place in the wide open spaces of his beloved Australia. They blend romance, adventure, sacrifice and deep sentiment (a quality I miss in our era of irony and detachment). Shute creates compelling characters -- his women are as well-drawn as his men -- who endure a lot and whose journey to hard-won wisdom is always riveting. ""Requiem"" is no exception. As its title suggests, it is a sad story but told with compassion and eloquence. It made me think about the unknown heroism and quiet desperation of people's lives and also about the dignity of each person's life. ""Requiem,"" like all of Shute's work, is a good, thought-provoking reading experience.
Summary 4: Suffering from overbearingly cheerful friends? Significant other a tad too upbeat?Forget sylvia plath. Throw away your Tolstoy. Give them this book.This is one of the most ridiculously depressing and tragic books i have ever read. It would be verging on parody if it were not for the beautiful prose, powerful message, and the momentum of the narrative.
Summary 5: Neville Shute had three phases of his writing. There were novels of England, both during and after the war. I have not read the novels from before the war. One of his wonderful wartime novels isMost Secret, which I have reviewed elsewhere. This novel has many similarities to that one as it involves wartime England and young people who must cope with the disastrous burden of war. Both novels have a story about a dog that ends in sadness. This novel continues after the war and is the first of his Australian stories. Alan, the older son and narrator, is an RAF pilot who is shot down after D-Day, which figures very large in this story, and loses his feet. He spends months of rehabilitation, then returns home to the family sheep station at Coombargana, in south Australia. He is restless and unhappy and soon returns to England to finish his studies at Oxford. Eventually, he returns to Australia, determined to live there and take over the station from his aging parents. On the day he arrives, which is the opening of the book, his father informs him that a parlour maid at home has taken her life. No one knows why.Most of the book is then told in flashback. He is puzzled about why the girl would end her life and he searches for information about her, finding her suitcase, which she has hidden in the attic. When he opens the suitcase, he learns that she is the girl his brother Bill would have married had he not been killed shortly before D-Day. Most of the book recounts their story and his own efforts to find her in England, and eventually in America, after the war. As he searches for her, he slowly comes to the conclusion that he was in love with her himself even though he had only met her once. His search has taught him much about her life and his determination to find her grows and becomes an obsession. Defeated at last, he returns to Australia only to learn that she has been caring for his parents while concealing her own identity. Why did she commit suicide the night before he arrives ?He reads her diary and learns how she was terribly harmed by the war, by his brother's death and by the life that remained for her as she became progressively more isolated. Finally, she travels to Australia on the advice of a friendly American physician she met in England. She finds peace and contentment in her anonymous service for Bill's parents. The prospect of Alan's return threatens her exposure and she chooses to end her life the day before the man who has been searching for her arrives.A Town Like Alicehas a similar story of a search after the war but with a happy ending.The Far Countryhas a story of an English girl who comes out to Australia to visit family in the same general area as this story. Both have roughly the same setting and there are similarities in the stories. My favorites are A Town Like Alice and No Highway but this novel is now in my top three. It has a somber, melancholy tone but so did Most Secret. Shute seems to do a good job with female characters and this is another example. If you like Neville Shute, this is one of his best.
Summary 6: I have just discovered Nevil Shute and I love his works. This book may start off a little slow in the first chapter (as all his seem to do) but it is an incredible story. I highly recommend it!"
0942272153,Santeria Experience,"Summary 1: This is one of the dearest books in my collection.The author unveils for us the strange and beautiful rituals that derive from the syncretism of Roman Catholicism, early forced on the Yoruba slaves of colonial Puerto Rico, with their own African nature religion. The book is Gonzalez-Wippler's labor of love, recounting lifelong first hand experiences of santeria in the care of her Yoruba nanny, with an attitude of respect and reverence for this great faith.The author tells of how her Maria gave her the first initiation of children in santeria, on her fifth birthday, first taking her to church to say a rosary before the statue of the Mother Mary, then taking her to an isolated cove, anointing her lips with sugarcane syrup, and leading her naked into the ocean waves, chanting an invocation to the orisha Yemaya, whose symbol is the seven seas and who is the mother of all things living. Maria explains to the child that Yemaya wears another face of the Virgin Mary, with dark skin and kind eyes, so that people who look like her can recognize her and receive her blessings. Maria explains that by bringing the child to Yemaya in the ocean, she is showing her Our Lady in her full power.There was another kind of santeria on the south side of San Antonio, where i grew up. As a child, when I asked parents and Sunday school teachers about the celebrants' strange processions, the shrines in their yards, the unfathomable usages of Christian symbols, their exotic botanicas, I was told that theirs was a sort of backwards, superstitious version of Christianity. ""Santeria Experience"" makes me wish that I had looked more closely and asked more questions, before it was too late.
Summary 2: This book is worth the money. Very educating view into the workings of the Afro Cuban religion. I would recommend this as very good for anyone interested in knowing and learning a bit more about this fascinating religion.Gary Serrao
Summary 3: Its great information made me just want to read more it showed me how i can achieve things on mind and spirit in this religion amazing!"
0198661819,The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang,"Summary 1: I purchased this book with the hopes of improving the dialog of contemporary characters in my writing. Unfortunately, most of the slang words included in this book is not very 'modern' and seem to come from the 20's-60's and earlier. This would be fine if you are writing a story about gangsters, gun molls or flower children.Unfortunately, I really don't see my characters using words like 'far-out,' 'drongo,' or 'face-fungus.'Overall, a disappointing purchase. Perhaps useful if you are writing historic fiction.
Summary 2: In reference to LadyNaava's complaint that this volume doesn't actually contain current or recent slang. I fear that's impossible. At least for a bound reference. In the time it takes to print a book, let alone compile a dictionary, current slang changes, changes back, disappears and is replaced.That said, the warning that this volume may not be up to date with many of the better ""regular"" dictionaries (which have recently added Homer's D'oh! after only twenty years) is appreciated.
Summary 3: Beware: contrary to the item description above, this volume is not organized thematically; it does not contain any section."
192902441X,Cognitive Coaching: A Foundation for Renaissance Schools,"Summary 1: This is a fantastic book for those who are in the position coaching other educators. It's very easy to understand, but gives you a lot to think about. Good tips like ""Don't overwhelm your coachees with too much data or questions to think about, because it dilutes the most important point you're trying to lead them to discover."" I highly recommend it.
Summary 2: Book arrived in a timely fashion and in very good condition; in fact, almost new.I would definitely recommend seller to others and would purchase again.Thanks.
Summary 3: It is what it is - a textbook that I had to have for a course I am taking. Not for light reading!!
Summary 4: Book came quickly and was in acceptable condition. I couldn't make it with all my textbooks if it wasn't for resale of them. Thank You!"
B000879GOQ,Selected religious poems of Solomon Ibn Gabirol (The Jewish Classics) (English and Hebrew Edition),"Summary 1: Of all the Jewish medieval poets who flourished in the golden age of Spanish-Jewish culture, Solomon ibn Gabirol was the greatest. This collection of devotional poetry was translated into English verse byIsrael Zangwillfrom a critical text by Professor Israel Davidson who was an authority on Hebrew poetry and Jewish liturgy.In the Introduction, Davidson discusses the scant biographical information and the nature and impact of Gabirol's timeless work, as well as those of his contemporaries. Born in Malaga in 1021 or 1022, Solomon was a prominent philosopher and poet, and a contemporary of El Cid, Spain's national hero. He belonged to the third period of Hebrew poetry in Spain.Orphaned at a young age, Gabirol spent his formative years in Saragossa and began his literary career when at about sixteen. He was supported by patrons, first Yekutiel then Samuel HaNagid. His other literary works include Biblical exegesis, Hebrew grammar, philosophy & ethics. More than 300 poems survive, half secular and half religious. Written in Arabic, only two of his more than 20 books on ethics and philosophy have survived, one of which is the famous Fountain of Life (Fons Vitae).The influence of theSefer Yetzirahon his poetry is marked, and his lyrics have a permanent appeal to the emotions, aspirations and yearning of mankind. Davidson quotes from Moses ben Ezra and Harizi, two medieval critics who appreciated his work. He concludes by affirming that Gabirol's words are a sanctuary to which the weary in heart turn for consolation, the troubled in mind for guidance and all lovers of beauty for partaking in exuberant joy.A chapter on the translation by Israel Zangwill comes next. The poems in this volume were all incorporated or designed for the liturgy of the synagogue. In them, one encounters the devotional spirit rooting itself more in individual expression than in tradition. There is a strong personal quality about them. Gabirol was the first Hebrew poet to use secular images and philosophy in his verse and also the first really great Hebrew poet to employ rhyme and meter.Before Gabirol, rhyme or meter was not used much. Biblical poetry has parallelism but it is mainly the accent that counts; in other words, it was free verse. The English translations are in rhyme in order to preserve the singing element, except for the magnificent Keter Malkut (The Royal Crown) which takes up 41 pages. The original Hebrew rhymes but has no fixed metre. A long philosophical poem, its exquisite beauty of expression complements its profundity of thought.There are 50 poems, from At The Dawn to The Royal Crown. The English versions are on the left page and the Hebrew on the right. They are most moving and spiritually uplifting, especially those dealing with the wounded heart of Israel. They are like a melody of eternal hope which brings the reader closer to God. All of them are stirring and memorable, but those I remember well after the first reading include The Messiah, Before My King, My Refuge, Ecstasy, The Redemption, God and Israel, My Lord and King, Lord of the World and Lord of Heaven.The book concludes with Notes on the Introduction, Notes on the Text (on the poems - mainly references to scripture and grammatical explanations), a Hebrew version of the previous and a short section titled Technical Payyetanic Terms in this Collection. These appear to be liturgical elements preceding prayers and benedictions, probably the same as what is called ""antiphons"" in Christian devotional music, for example the work ofHildegard von Bingen.For those interested in Jewish devotional music from around the world, I recommend the CDKabbalah Music: Songs of the Jewish Mysticsby Laura Wetzler. It includes three tracks from the Spanish Sephardi tradition: Kol Haneshama Meditation, Respondemos and Yom Zeh L'Yisrael.Youthby Matisyahu is a splendid example of a more contemporary and popular type of spiritual music in the Jewish tradition.Complete list of poems:At the DawnMy Soul Shall DeclareThe MessiahInvitationThree Things ConspireBefore My KingOpen the GatePour Out Thy HeartSix Years Were Decreed`Tis Joy to MeMy RefugeEcstasyI Have Sought Thee DailyHumble of SpiritFor a MarriageThe SunThe RedemptionGod and IsraelReassuranceDuologueEstablish PeaceJudgmentPrayer for the HazzanTwo Things Have MetFor New Year's DayMy Lord and KingBlow Ye the TrumpetLet the Isles RejoiceFor the Day of MemorialGod Dwelleth HighFor Atonement EveLord of the WorldLord, What is Man?The Day of JudgmentLamentationThe Dwellers in Clay
Summary 2: Solomon Ibn Gabirol was born in Malaga, around the year 1021. When he was sixteen, he began a poem, ""I am the Master, and Song is my slave."" At twenty, he composed an alphabetical, acrostic Hebrew grammar of over four hundred rhyming verses. He wrote books of moral maxims, and a philosophical treatise that married Neoplatonism to Judaism. His longest poem, ""The Royal Crown"", incorporates the most current knowledge of the heavens, describing the qualities and dimensions of the planets. Many of his poems have been incorporated into Jewish liturgy.It is said that, after years of wandering through Spain, he was murdered by a jealous Muslim poet, who buried him beneath the roots of a fig tree, the fruit of which became incredibly sweet. Others say he was trampled to death by a Moorish knight.The poems in this particular collection vary greatly in quality, and much of this can be laid at the feet of the translator, Israel Zangwill, whose desire to make the translations rhyme is often fatal. In spite of this, many of the poems are quite remarkable, particularly ""The Royal Crown"". Progressing from the Earth and outward through the solar system, Ibn Gabirol describes the successive crystal spheres, beginning each section with a phrase along the lines of ""Who can comprehend God's greatness? For Thou hast encompassed sphere X with sphere Y."" Some of this is a little tedious, but as the poem progresses it contrasts the mind's power to understand the external universe with its powerlessness in understanding God and life. Some of these passages are quite effective, and are often interlaced with actual scriptural text. It's only a shame that Zangwill's language is unequal to Ibn Gabirol's ideas.

Summary 4: I found it interesting. It will be used in an adult ed. class. I will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems, how it reflects the times and how comfortable gabirol was in Medieval Spain
Summary 5: Solomon ibn Gabriol 1021-1058 is one of the great Jewish medieval poets and thinkers. He lived a difficult life of wandering . His poetry is filled with a strong sense of the majesty of God. And his works are part of the Jewish liturgy."
0842382852,Degrees of Guilt: Tyrone's Story,"Summary 1: This is an excellent series, but out of the three, Tyrone's Story was the best by far. I cried so many times throughout all three books.To really understand the story he to read Kyra's Story and Miranda's Story. I liked Tyrone's because it tied the event together. What happens is someone in the town (a teenager) is killed but why? Tyrone, Miranda, and Kyra all feel responsible but who really killed Sammy? These books take you by surprise and make you realize that this time of scenario could happen in your town...............if it already hasn't.
Summary 2: Review by Gretchen HoffmanTyrone's Story by Sigmund Brouwer is the other book in the Degrees of Guilt trilogy. Eighteen-year-old Tyrone Larson is a high school senior with a passion for science. Having grown up with a not-so-hot home life, he's armed with a cynical personality and smart-mouth attitude.Tyrone's story focuses on the events that lead up to the death of his friend, Sammy. With everything from school, friends, and girls, to his own involvement in Sammy's death, Tyrone must sort through life to discover who he is and what life is really about.I definitely enjoyed this book. It was probably my favorite part of the series, probably because of Tyrone's love for science. If you've read the other two books, pick this one up too!
Summary 3: Unfortunately I didn't read this book. My daughter read it very quickly, so I'm thinking it must have been a good one.
Summary 4: I work with teens in detention facilities. They love the Degrees of Guilt series! It touches their world. I highly reccommed it for any teenager. This book is my favorite of the three. It touches what it feels like to not fit in and to have your life a mess. It also shows how easily you can fall into wrong choices that lead to severe consequences.I think any teen would like it and relate to it. I liked it myself as an adult. It is very true to the teen world.
Summary 5: This book is about a person named Tyrone who a friend from school has named Sammy who supposedly died from being hit by a car at a party. The story follows Tyrone as the police question him, who thinks that he had something to do with the death of Sammy. Tyrone's friend or now ex- friend fled after Sammy's death, back to Hazard County Kentucky, where a life long of criminal relatives live. The police also think Hale, the friend from Hazard County, also had something to do with the death. There on, you find out if a car really hit Sammy and see if Tyrone and hale maybe were involved.What I liked about this book is how you wonder and how it makes you think about if something really did happen to Sammy. If a car did not hit him, then what really happened? I also like how it also tells about Tyrone's life, because Tyrone's life kind of fits into the story in a way. It is not all about Sammy and it is not all about Tyrone. Some things I disliked about the book is how Tyrone talks so much about since and some of it didn't make much sense. In addition, they somewhat over loaded it a little bit. Another thing I do like in the book is it talks about god a little bit every once in awhile and I thought that was great.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little mystery and who likes to think when he or she read books, such as trying to figure out what really happened."
2843237297,Video Game Art,"Summary 1: A very nice book. It goes a long way in demonstrating both the depth and breadth of this newest of visual mediums; treating it with the respect it deserves. There is a lot of work that goes into creating the dazzling visuals many gamers may take for granted, or worse, criticize in ignorance of the technological limits game artists work with.I must confess I am biased as I am one of those artists toiling in the game development business. One of my images and a substantial quote of mine is used in the text of the book. Sadly however, credit is not given to me or any of the nameless, faceless artists whose work is so lovingly showcased. As a game artist, I would love to know who created this work both for my personal edification as well as for reference for future hiring potential. Obviously, some images represent the work of many artists and programmers, however, a large amount of the work included in this book was created by individuals who deserve credit. What crediting there is, is given only to the marketing executives and companies who delivered the work to the author. For all of its effort to showcase the artistic merit of video games, this book fails to recognize those who create the art, only crediting the corporate entities who paid for it.Still, a worth while buy.
Summary 2: The trouble starts early. There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that which are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community. This is an enormous assumption about the general public's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it's history of design. Many people that have heard of these games or have seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like.Even though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the 'new-time' classics? The latter are better represented but some of the choices and omissions are rather questionable. The brief smattering of 'classics' that are shown tend to represent more human and figurative character styles in games rather than 'iconic' which to me lacks in breadth of representation.Beyond this, much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather 'same-y' to me. Lots of brooding dark scenes and characters inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters. When there is mention of games that are actually considered contemporary-art on display at world-famous museums, such as ""Rez,"" -- we are not shown ANY images of these because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft in the same spread. At this point one has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?For all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to show us where the industry came from versus where we are now. And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and unique designs being done in FLASH - arguably one of the largest and least expensive environments for making accessible games and game 'art'. Furthermore, all the games covered and discussed (that I can tell) are from large corporations and studios. What of independent developers?My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art. Far too many examples if things that look similar versus examples of unique design concepts and forms. Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and even some interesting topics are raised with relation to character concept, versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design, ""art"" analysis, or a balanced representation.
Summary 3: Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys."
B0007FBOXA,Middle Eastern mythology (Pelican books),"Summary 1: This book provided a fascinating review of early Middle Eastern mythology starting from Mesopotamian culture and proceeding through to Judaism and early Christianity. It also includes a discussion of the importance of myth and ritual as a basis for religious and socialogical structure. The area I found most interesting was the discussion of the influence of the mythology of early civilizations on Judeo-Christian belief and scripture.
Summary 2: I am so glad I found out about this book. Reading it was a major eye opener for me in understanding the early myths from the area where my own (former) religion originated. S. H. Hooke is an expert in mythology, and he does a fantastic job of showing the connections between the myths of the Middle East. For me personally, this helped me see how the roots of Christianity (particularly with ancient Hebrew religions) was inspired greatly by earlier myths. Whether it was the author's intention or not, it also helped me realize that the religion I once thought was real was, in fact, nothing more than a myth that was not unlike so many similar myths of the time and place.Jeff Mark, author ofChristian No More
Summary 3: This book has been republished a number of times now and that is probably due to its addressing of a subject that is bound to repeatedly be of interest to a number of people. In a nutshell this brief book discusses a range of myths from the Middle East. It does not claim to be an encyclopaedia of that areas mythology and deities nor does it claim to contain every story of each of the cultures that have come and gone over the years in the region in question. Nor does it set out to any form of historical work in a chronological sense though perforce there is some discussion of the chronology of different cultures in order to discuss their influence on each other.What the book does do is to present a number of salient stories in readable laymans prose from a range of early cultures of the area. What we also get is a look at how many of the stories many would think of as being from the Christian Bible were quite obviously drawn from earlier works. I'm guessing that might ruffle a few feathers but the author does not dally about with looking too deeply into that aspect of things, he merely draws parallels and leaves it at that.This isn't a bad book for your history bookshelf though there are undoubtedly far more brightly presented and illustrated works on Middle Eastern pantheons and the like and certainly many of them probably benefit from more recent archaeological work that has been done since its inception and some that will look more thoroughly at individual cultures rather than this broader based work.
Summary 4: This book was written more than 45 years ago and it shows; there have been much new data on middle eastern mythology, particularly concerning Judeo-Christian mythology.Hooke, unlike Joseph Campbell in his books, shows his obvious pro-Christian bias: ""we have in the birth narratives of the gospels an extension of the function of myth as a vehicle for CONVEYING TRUTHS which lie outside the range of historical evidence"" (p172-3). This is a contradictory statement, truths have evidence, otherwise they are just dogma (a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof); this statement is based on Christian dogma, not fact. The new testament was written by Hebrews/Early Christians after Jesus had been dead awhile to elevate him to god-like status; there is no written documentation on the life of Jesus from anyone who lived while Jesus lived; however, Hooke seemed to think the new testament writings were actually done by people who personally knew Jesus.If you want mythology overviews that are objective and up-to-date, look for it elsewhere; preferably one written within the last decade or so."
0975533177,The Collector's Edition of the Lost Erotic Novels,"Summary 1: It certainly seems to me that some of the best erotic literature was written in Victorian times when, absent TV's, DVD's and pay per view porn and erotica, most people had to find thewir erotic enjoyment with friends, family, neighbours, and, most importantantly in their own minds.This wonderful book of four full erotic novels certainly brings that point home.In 'The Instruments of Passion' a young man decides to join a very much monastery with only seven members that practiced some, what would appear to be strange, rituals of bondage and the whipping of a very young girl, also a resident, named Daisy. The young writer is astonished by her beauty and her willingness to submit to the torture and pain of the monks daily ritual. Everything seems so normal, so traditional and so important in their search for inner peace that our innocent observer very quickly accepts all .... That is until a certain day when there is a 'graduation' of sorts and our young innocent's world and his unrequited love for Daisy comes to a crashing end ....In 'The Misfortunes of Mary' we find another very much Victorian novel where a mature Colonel Barrington agrees to a secretarial contract with a very and beautifull young girl, Mary. Although all appears normal, our young secretary, now contractually bound, finds that she is in an impossible postion and the jaded colonel immediately starts to play mind games demanding her total submission to those yummie yummie whims.The author takes the reader along a meandering erotica path making all seem rather 'normal' and of course understandable .... A great book for those that appreciate Victorian erotica..In 'White Stains', the third novel by Naais Nin we are treated to four very short mini stories that are the hallmark of a very eclectic author whose works many people have grown to love.Finally, in 'Innocence' by Harrier Daimler a young and very sickly Adrian is confined to bed on the very edge of death when finally his mother and father decide to hire a nurse to care for their son in his last days. Again, in this contemporary erotica, all is not what it seems. While the world around him sees Adrian as a poor sickly boy, the reader is treated to the real secret life of Adrian where he is able to use his weakness and intelligence to get 'everthing' he wants from the nursemaid, Rose, while pretty well controlling everyone else around him ....A great mind bending and deliciously naughty work by this author .... I loved it!
Summary 2: I have been reading Victorian erotica for a very long time. I realize that spanking and whipping are frequent themes in Victorian erotica. Also, it's common for men in these novels to more or less force themselves on women. I expect some of that, and usually overlook those parts figuring that's part of the historical context. However, this book contains way too much rape and sexual violence for my taste, and very little that is erotic.The first book is The Instruments of Passion. A young girl is a prisoner in a ""monastary"" of sorts. She is beaten by the monks each night. When she reaches a milestone birthday each monk rapes her while she is tied up and struggling. I didn't finish this book. It was all ugly to me. However, if you like S&M; or have gang rape fantasies you might like it.The second book is The Misfortunes of Mary. In this one a Madam lures a young innocent girl into her house by placing a fake ad for a secretary. The young lady finds herself locked into a room with a retired Colonel who rapes and beats her. Unbeknownst to both the colonel and the victim, three men are paying to watch the rape. After the colonel leaves those three men also rape and beat the poor girl. However, one girl was not enough for them, so they have the daughter of one of the three men brought in, and she is also raped and beaten. Not at all erotic to me, but it may be to some.The third book is a collection of stories listed as being by Anais Nin ""and friends."" These are better. There is one very lovely story about a soldier who spend the night in an attic with his ladylove. It is her first time with a man. No rape, no beating. I really liked that story, but it is not worth the price of the whole bookThe final book is Innocence. This one is very strange, and only partly about sex. A young girl is confined to bed. She and her parents know she will eventually die. Although her parents are concerned and caring, she hates them. She is filed with dark, secret thoughts of hatred. She is extremely spoiled and unsympathetic. As her condition worsens a nursemaid is brought in. The girl and the nursemaid have some lesbian sex, even though the girl dislikes the nursemaid and thinks of her only as a servant. The girl wants to know about male female sex. She forces the nursemaid to seduce her father. The girl pretends to be asleep, while the nursemaid seduces him to have sex right in the same bed with his invalid daughter. The second part of the book is told from the point of view of a young male cousin who arrives from France. He knows the girl is dying. His goal is to set himself up as the heir to the family fortune. He and his father use women and sex for financial gain. He is a nasty piece of work, as bad as his sickly cousin. The sex scenes in this book are not especially explicit or well described, which is fine because none of the characters were inspiring anyway. You might read this last book because it is oddly interesting, but it is in no way erotic.I think there is a good reason that most of these books are ""lost"" as the anthology title states.
Summary 3: I just bought the book ""The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica"" and ""The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica"" from Amazon. I find there's some question in edition of the two books. As anthologies, the books include many novels, but they do not have bibliography and I can not firnd authors' names of these novels,we even want to know more about these authors' information. Anyway, the books should indicate which novles are full and others are excerpts(we should know the excerpt from which chapter of the original novel ).I have no idea of them. So I am not very satisfactory of the two books."
B000MU839I,Sengoku: Character Sheets,"Summary 1: Of all the Japanese style rpg's done over the years this one is the best by far. But with all the talk of Legends of the five rings and about how good it is meant to be. It can become hard to find an alternative.But there is an alternative to the corperate heavy and rigid L5R. And that alternative offers you something that L5R does not...choice.Sengoku is all about choice. It gives pages and pages about the Sengoku era. It gives you the choice of playing Ninja characters. Something L5R treats with distain. It gives you the choice of realistic to flying through the air styles of game. It talks about having a mixed party of Samurai and Ninja and how each style of game is different with that in mind.The information is very well defined and laid out. Some of the rules are a little harder to understand. A little more clarity would not have gone astray here and there. But that does not ruin how good a game this is. This game is all about role play and not about having to fit within the designers idea of what is good.Of them all I strongly recommend Sengoku. And if you find that you just can't tear yourself away from L5R then you will even find converstion notes in the back of the Sengoku book. This book is worth the money.
Summary 2: This is a role-playing game but the depth of the background material is such that it could nearly be a history book on ancient and medieval Japan. The material is well organized and I have found myself reading this book simply for the enjoyment of learning the background. As a role-playing game I think Sengoku has few equals. I own dozens of RPGs and this volume is among the best in my collection.
Summary 3: Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read."
B000MUGWFK,4 Zinas: A Story of Mothers and Daughters on the Mormon Frontier,"Summary 1: Four Zinas: A Story Of Mothers And Daughters On The Mormon Frontier is the story of a four-generation family of women who shared many things in common, foremost of which was the name Zina. Zina Baker Huntington converted to Mormonism in New York in 1835. Her daughter, Zina Huntington Young married Joseph Smith, and upon his death, married Brigham Young and served as the Mormon Church's general Relief Society President. Then her daughter, Zina Young Card assisted her husband, Charles Ora Card, in founding Cardston, Alberta, Canada. And in time, her daughter, Zina Card Brown married future Mormon church apostle Hugh B. Brown. Four Zinas is the fascinating story of how this extended family helped to shape their respected eras within the Mormon community. Zina Young and Zina Card worked tirelessly for woman's suffrage, encouraging women to study nursing and become involved in industry. All of the women promoted drama and literature, inspiring others through their speeches and expressions of spirituality (including the Mormon custom of &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;. These were women who enabled Mormon women to feel good about themselves, and in the process, made their frontier worlds welcome places to establish families and enjoy life. Four Zinas is very highly recommended for women's studies, American frontier studies, and Mormon history studies reading lists.
Summary 2: I loved this book. It has a great historical content to the founding of our nation, as well as the beginning of the LDS church. It has photos and letters spanning four generations, and amazing stories throughout. I particularly loved the letters during the war of 1812. For our family, it's particularly a touching memoir as it is our direct ancestor line. It is not only a must read, but we are purchasing additional copies for our children to have when they are grown. Beautifully written, and well researched. It doesn't get better than this!
Summary 3: It has been a while since I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. In particular, I did not like how the 2nd Zina was treated."
0840783280,Holy Bible Compact Reference Edition with Snap-Flap Closure NKJV (New King James Version),"Summary 1: I really liked the size and the font but the pages were coming off the binding. Also, the snap was too difficult and I think using it would cause the binding to separate. I returned it but would have loved it except that one main issue.
Summary 2: This item came in perfect condition still wrapped and in its box. It was exactly what I thought it would be from the description and I am completely satisfied! The only problem was that shipping took a while, but I guess that is only because I ordered it around the end of the Holiday season.
Summary 3: This Bible is a treasure. I've been using it for 12 years, and am on about my fourth or fifth one (lots of study notes and cross referencs of my own). It's perfect to take with you everywhere, but more than that, the references are fantastic, and are a powerful study help. I have given away several of these Bibles over the years, and everyone I've given it to sings its praises too. I highly recommend this New King James Version Bible."
0867165960,Here On The Way To There: A Catholic Perspective On Dying And What Follows,"Summary 1: Shannon, a priest and professor emeritus in the religions studies department at a Nazareth College, makes an important point in his introduction that informs much of what follows. He offers dictionary definitions for ""death"" and ""dying,"" each dealing with endings. He then gives the Christian definitions: ""Death is the beginning of life, life at its best, at its most real"" and dying is ""to start living in a most wondrous way."" He also takes care to explore death and dying as two different experiences that reflect continuity (existence continues after death) and discontinuity (existence after death is radically different from existence before death.)Against that background, Shannon addresses the form of life after death, comparing it to resurrection (Jesus) not resuscitation (Lazarus) and posits that the ""the resurrection of the body and life everlasting"" expressed in the Creed are experienced at the end of each person's mortal experience, ""which, for that person, is the end of time.""These are but a few examples of the richness Shannon brings to this imminently readable and thought-provoking work. Other topics include funeral rites and organ donation, diminishments of old age with practical advice on living wills, hospice care, and medical decisions. As one would expect, the author also looks at questions of hell, and purgatory, limbo, and reincarnation. The final section, What We Believe about Heaven, tackles questions about heaven as a family reunion, a garden of delight, the Garden of Eden, and the Glorious Royal City. The book closes with answers to frequently asked questions about heaven, nearly 100 notes, and an index.
Summary 2: I sat down on Friday night, figuring to spend most of the weekend ""working through"" Here on the Way to There. I finished before I had lunch on Saturday. It was not exactly in one sitting, but i read the book through in one ""go"" as it were, following its points and even anticipating some of it, but most of all, appreciating, deeply feeling the truth and gentility in what it said.This book is so very much like Shannon's other writings and his public addresses in tone and pace that you can actually hear his voice in the words. The same mix of deep intellect, and easy understanding, putting next to each other Milton, Joyce, the Doctors of the Church, and quotes from your aunt! and they all fit and flow and create a ""seamless garment"" that fits so comfortably.I was very impressed ,and very moved by many of the things that Shannon said. Let me refer to some of them.The idea of passion as something that is endured, or suffered. Yes, that is exactly what passion is, in any of its forms, and to think of dying as a passion is something that never occurred to me, no matter how many times ""The Passion of Jesus"" ran through my ears (page 7).The necessity of ""the person... to forgive himself or herself and open the depths of his or her heart to God"" is something that I have seen in those I have seen die (page 9).It never occurred to me that ""death is ....something that we do....an action."" (page 13) but of course it is. It is something that takes all our concentration. And that is why death is often precedes by more than a week the cessation of biological functions.Shannon says ""In death we at last cease to live the illusion of a separate, self-centered existence and realize that our life is -- and always has been -- lived with God in Christ and without sisters and brothers ( page 14)."" And that is precisely why suicide is not an option, it seems to me, because suicide is a self-centered, self-absorbed act. What we want, what we think we need, a kind of ultimate self-centered existence.The fact that ""you cannot see your own face.... The reflection of your face is not your face....."" (page 15) is very much like that painting of a pipe by Magritte that is labeled ""This is not a pipe."" It never occurred to me. And so, the ""Beatific"" vision is not only seeing and recognizing the face of God, it is also seeing and recognizing our own face! As the Rabbi you tell of did not at first recognize his name when it was read at the gate of Heaven.And so on, and so on, there are just too many things I want to say about the book, too many passages I want to talk about for me to go over them all here.Fr. Shannon's book is a comfort and a blessing, beyond words.
Summary 3: Thoughtful, easy to understand, relevant to today's everyday life in America. This book, written by a theologian is a wonderful book for 'all' Christians and non-Christians alike.
Summary 4: Having just lost (though not really) a great friend and mentor two weeks ago Sunday, I was desperately looking for consolation in my grief. I found this book in a near by bookstore convinced that my friend had herself gifted me with it. Because her passing was very sudden and shocking, the first part of the book did not call out to me but the parts on what happens afterward were immensely consoling. The quote by Karl Rahner alone is worth the price of the book and its found on p.129.A beautiful and compassionate gift to all believe.
Summary 5: I was extremely pleased with the book I purchased. It was more than I expected for the price. Thank you."
0813026229,From the Swamp to the Keys: A Paddle through Florida History,"Summary 1: This is the telling of a personal adventure story. It is a mix of Florida history in bits and pieces, some personal history (how Johnny Molloy got into outdoor writing--to make a living enjoying the outdoors), and some personal philosophy: ""I had come to believe, as I still do, that time, not money, is the most valuable commodity on earth."" It is NOT a ""how to"" book. Perhaps, with his 4 other books on hiking, camping, and paddling in Florida, he felt no need to elaborate on how to prepare and execute such a trip. It is a book about what he saw along the way, of his conversations with locals and travelers he met, of his love for the outdoors and dissatisfaction with urban life. His writing is somewhat routine as he paddles down the Suwannee River and out onto the Gulf coast, then to Cedar Key, and past Tampa (where he encounters the most dangerous conditions of the trip as he crosses the mouth of Tampa Bay). He seems to relish paddling by ""the seat of his pants."" He goes up/down rivers against the tide--a tough paddle. He arrives at Graveyard campsite in the Everglades after dark and swarms of no-see-ums threaten to eat him alive. After donning protective clothes and a head net, he finds the head net is for mosquitoes but no defense against the much smaller no-see-ums. It is clear you will never see Johnny Molloy use a modern convenience like a GPS. Johnny's writing becomes much more interesting the further south he travels and reaches its best in the Everglades, an area which he has paddled and written about extensively. If you enjoy the outdoors and paddling, it is a good read.
Summary 2: This is a great book for anyone wishing a glimpse of what Florida was really like a generation ago. The descriptions of the trip down the Suwannee River in the book match the vivid memories I have of my childhood playgrounds....don't miss it!
Summary 3: this was a terrific adventure as you take the turns of the river, ride the currents, buck the winds, weather the storms and sense the beauty of Fla. as you cast eyes on development only to imagine what parts of it would have looked like back 50 years ago. You are brought closer to nature and experience adventure that you only wish you would dare to attempt. A great story and a great enduring ride. thanks for sharing."
1859679129,The World Encyclopedia of Bread and Bread Making,"Summary 1: This book is written from a British perspective. Some of the worst bread in the world is to be found in Britain, and some of the best in France. Upon reading this book, however, you might get the opposite impression. The attitude of the authors to non-British breads is rather pedestrian. The suggestion to hollow out savory brioche and stuff it with mushrooms or grilled peppers is not one of &quot;the most delicious ways of using&quot; it, but a rather horrid suggestion (the book is full of such marginal serving suggestions). It also criticizes Pain Poilane because it can be &quot;disappointing&quot;, as if British bread were any better.The first 3 dozen pages have a history and primer on bread making. The section on forming breads is too short to be of any help; you will need to consult a more detailed explanation in another bread book. The next hundred pages is an atlas with 2 dozen or so countries and the breads therein. In spite of the fact that each bread description has a chatty entry, the descriptions of the individual breads do not always describe what the ingredients are or what it tastes like. Not all encyclopedia entries have a picture, although many of them do (all of the recipes do). The last section has roughly 100 bread recipes of varying quality. Many are very interesting, using such things like all purpose flour or employing a second dough kneading after the initial proof. On the whole, I liked the recipe section but thought that the encyclopedia section was kind of a waste of time. The only real problem is the small size of the text (you'll need reading glasses for this one) to go along with the small 7 x 9 size of the page.The authors are British; on the good side, it means that all of the flour measurements in the recipes are listed by weight (halleluiah!), but it also means that some of the terminology is confusing to Americans. The ingredients are those of a British grocery store, so you will have to make substitutions for American ingredients (equivalents are not supplied).The procedures are mostly very detailed and easy to follow, although steps describing the proper dough textures or doneness while baking breads are not detailed enough (for example, if you follow their instructions for baking croissants, you will under bake them) Some of the procedures are difficult to understand or execute, and often lacking in sufficient detail. Also, the hydration levels of some of the doughs were apparently not correct, and the recipe instructions do not always describe the proper dough texture. The proofing times were often too short. The procedures listed for some of the sourdough breads may or may not work as specified.It is an interesting, useful, and wide-ranging collection of European bread recipes not often found here in the US (there are a dozen or so American bread recipes). They have interesting flavors, but not all of them are good. It is a good collection of bread recipes to have, and many are worth trying at least once. In spite of the incompleteness and unreliability, it is a useful and enlightening guide.
Summary 2: This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world. The rest is bread recipes from each part of the world.The pictures are nice and gives us an idea of what bread is in Germany, in France, in Japan, in the middle east. However, when I tried a couple of the recipes, they all turned out below average--and I am experienced in bread-making. I would suggest people who want to 'bake' to look somewhere else, such as 'the village baker'
Summary 3: If you have never made a loaf of homemade bread you have missed out on one of the most therapeutic experiences in the kitchen. The sensory delight you will experience as the bread cooks is nothing short of magical.Understandably, many of us do not have time to wait for bread to rise or feel insecure about the process of kneading. Put your fears aside, you can do this. Start on a Saturday afternoon and learn all you can. As an avid reader of history and culture, I enjoyed the history and Introduction chapters almost as much as the page after page of homemade goodness. For once the pictures actually look like what you will achieve in a home kitchen.There is an entire section on breads from various locations. Whether you just enjoy imagining you will make a loaf of bread, or want to purchase a gift for a friend....This is the book on bread you will both love.~The Rebecca Review
Summary 4: I am relatively new to breadmaking (just 3 years) and I have found several of the basic instructions, not proofing in metal, making a sponge, using a wooden spoon and slow rising, to be invaluable.So many bread books are too complex, they are made for graduate level pastry chefs with giant woodburning ovens and pantries that Martha Stewart would envy.The pictures and lists are excellent. I saved myself time looking up the gluten content of oats and quinoa flour because it's in the book along with information on other exotic flours like rye and stone ground. The pictures of the effects of different glazes, ie; sugar versus flour are great and oh so useful.The pain ordinaire has become a regular for me. I even feel confident enough in my breadmaking to try out a wild grape starter recipe I found on Allrecipes and have incorporated it into the recipes in this book. I would never have done that before, because bread seemed so difficult and mysterious. As if only professional bakers (and the Orowheat) factory could make bread. But here I am, churning out oatmeal bread and pain ordinaire with a salt crust for Sunday dinner!I have tried four of the recipes in the book and three turned out perfect (not sure about the whole grain-seed rolls). In my mind, any recipe book that has at least three recipes that turn out and are tasty enough to be made again, well, that's a good cookbook.I can't tell you the number of times I have picked up a recipe book, flipped through it and found that, in the entire book there was only one, maybe two recipes I would be interested in trying."
1902405129,Astrology and Meditation,"Summary 1: If you want to know how astrological interpretation really works, if you desire to be able to read a chart in depth, then you must read this book, as it is one of the best books ever written about astrology.I have practiced astrology for many years, and really don't read lots of books on it anymore. Most of them are written for beginners, or are sun sign books, which really don't explain this discipline at all. Some are poorly written, or are extremely judgmental, or they repeat what others have already said, none of which I am interested in.Yet a few out there are jewels. There are the great teachings of Rudhyar, perhaps the greatest astrologer since Ptolemy; he has transformed astrology forever. I still refer to Astrological Mandala, especially when trying to unravel a tough planetary symbol. And there are others that I am not going to discuss here. Believe me, Astrology & Meditation deserves to be on that must-read list. It was introduced quietly into the world (in 2002, I believe), and it is still almost unknown. Some books are born that way. Someday everyone will know about it, because excellence always rises to the top.Greg Bogart is a philosopher, a psychotherapist, a psychologist, a university professor, a practitioner of many spiritual esoteric disciplines, including astrology. He pours all of his knowledge, acquired from years of study and practice, into this book. Moreover, he pours his heart into it too. That means that it is an experiential book: If you read and study its chapters, I mean really live in it as one must do with any profound book, then you will come to know more about astrology than ever before, and you will, if reading charts, see far deeper into any chart that you examine. You will give better readings than ever gave in your life. When books of heart fill our soul, that's just how it works.If you are just beginning to study astrology, I recommend that you purchase this book, and read it. Even if you do not understand some of the technical terms like solar arcs, or progressions, or yods, extended definitions are just a few clicks away on the internet. If I discovered a book like Astrology & Meditation, when I was beginning my study of astrology, it would have saved me years of having to plough through bad books, faulty interpretations, erroneous judgments that I would later have to eradicate, often painfully.Even as an advanced astrologer, I find it a wonderful read. Sometimes it is the quotes from high spiritual teachers to which I return repeatedly to study, for these passages are filled with wisdom; at other times I like to re-read his interpretations--they are extremely valuable, and I find that I agree with them almost always, and they give me a different way of seeing things.If you are employing astrology for healing, for growth, for counseling, or just studying it out of a general philosophical interest, you should get this book, read it, and absorb it. Then read it again, and keep it with you for the rest of your life.
Summary 2: Many of the astrology titles on my shelves are reference-type works that I've only read selected parts of, but ""Astrology and Meditation"" can easily be read from cover to cover. Not only is it relatively short, but there is a single thread or theme running throughout, which is the attempt to demonstrate an approach to astrology that focuses on the higher purpose, intention, or meaning behind a certain planetary position, aspect, progression, or transit. Another reason it's such a readable book is that the general observations and discussions are continually interspersed with specific examples from the author's many clients. Greg Bogart writes in a simple and clear style, focusing mainly on the ten planets, and the book's forty-five displayed charts often show as few as one, two, or three natal planets, along with the particular transiting planet(s) to illustrate his point.Not only is it a very readable book, but it's one that should be read. The idea that we can try to understand the higher purpose or lesson to be learned, rather than worrying about the possible negative consequences from an upcoming transit by Uranus or Pluto, is a very important one that people like me particularly, whose outlook tends to be more fatalistic than humanistic, need to fully appreciate- even if putting the book's advice into practice turns out to be a lot more difficult than agreeing with it in principle.Incidentally, my copy says that it was published in 2002.
Summary 3: I have another favorite here and I am not one to meditate, fact is I barely have time to think lately. I found this book extremely important to me. Once I started reading it- I could barely put it down. The book showed me the importance of stopping to see the meaning of each symbol in Astrology, to value each meaning and see the positive in chart analysis. Its not just informative its enlightening. I love this book, Its a keeper!"
B0006AUIAG,Opera as drama,"Summary 1: Why does opera exist as a form? Why do people attend operas, and listen to them? Why should you do so? This classic, brilliant book by Kerman makes the case clearly and strongly.Opera is drama; beyond the staged spectacles and emblambed warhorses that seem to draw the biggest audiences, opera exists to convey drama, especially the drama of interior actions, emotions and existence. This is why characters are singing, not merely speaking.Kerman uses the examples, in case study form, of arguably histories greatest operas to point out why the form exists and thrives, and also what makes a work good, and what makes one fail. He begins with Monteverdi and ends with 20th century works like ""Wozzeck"" and ""The Rakes Progress,"" while also covering Verdi, Wagner, Mozart. His chapter on Mozart's operas is one of the greatest pieces of musical critical thinking that has been written, it explains the greatness of Mozart as an opera composer and also the near-greatness, and flaws, of ""Don Giovanni"" and ""Cosi fan tutte."" Kerman also points out what some popular works fail as drama, and thus as opera.This is the single best work to introduce listeners to the form. Highest recommendation.
Summary 2: Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally.
Summary 3: This is one of the most thought-provoking books on music I have read. While you may not always agree with him, Kerman makes you think through your attitudes and ideas. I gained much insight from him and recommend this book highly to those who want to delve deeply into opera."
B000OTPAJS,Law (The) of Business Organizations,"Summary 1: I really like this corporate law textbook. Very readable and easy to understand with simple examples which help you to remember definitions and concepts. I have been required to purchase textbooks for other paralegal classes which were so poorly written that the teacher never even referred to them; what a waste of money! Not so with this book! I plan on keeping it on my bookshelf long after my corporate law class is done!
Summary 2: I'm using this book as a textbook for paralegal studies. It is exhausting reading, with something of a tendency to inundate one with too much detail before the big-picture gets explained. It would help to have a comparative chart of the different types of organizations.
Summary 3: This is a very good book and I have learned a lot from it. Anyone who wants to learn business law or brush up on their knowledge, this is the book for you."
0816514437,To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration,"Summary 1: Don Wilhelms was a member of the Apollo Scientific Team and the US Geological Survey. In this book he describes his role, along with his geologist colleagues, during the Apollo explorations of the Moon. In addition, he presents a brief history of the theories associated with the origin of the moon and its craters, the people and problems involved in the section of the Apollo landing sites, a discussion of the geological results obtained from each of the Apollo landing sites, and finally a summary of the findings from the Apollo missions and the development of a theory to explain the formation of the moon.The book opens with several chapters that describe the early telescopic observations of the moon and the competing theories explaining the moon origins. Specifically, there was the cold formation/capture theory and the hot formation/formed with Earth theory. After this thorough explanation of the development of these theories, the author covers the early robotic exploration of the moon conducted by the Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter probes. From these missions, it was determined that the majority of the Moon's craters were probably created by meteoroid impact. Within these sections, the author also describes the landing site selection process.Except for the concluding section and appendices, the remainder of the book (approximately 50%) covers in detail, the geological exploration conducted by the astronauts at each landing site and the results obtained. Since the early flights to the moon, Apollos 11, 12 and 14, were shorts stay, the book emphasizes the extensive geological exploration conducted by the Apollos 15, 16 and 17 missions. These missions included an electrically powered car, which greatly extended the areas of the moon that the astronauts could explore. These final missions were also supported in real time by a scientific support room staffed with many highly skilled geologists that helped to direct the astronauts during sample collection.I found this book to be highly enjoyable and its covers an aspect of the Apollo program that is usually not covered in great detail. That is, the people behind the scenes who helped make this project the great success that it was. On the flip side, some readers may find the book a bit too technical, especially with all the geological terms and the small amount of the supporting diagrams and figures.
Summary 2: This lengthy and detailed account of lunar exploration and science strikes a balance between personal memoir and history. As history it provides a detailed and contextual account of lunar geology during the 1960s and 1970s, and a less detailed but informative account for the rest of the century. As memoir it provides an engaging story of the scientific exploration of the Moon as seen by one of the field's more important behind-the-scenes scientists who worked on Apollo.This is certainly the most detailed personal account of lunar science during the Apollo program, and should be read in tandem with Donald A. Beattie's ""Taking Science to the Moon: Lunar Experiments and the Apollo Program"" (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001).
Summary 3: I must confess that I came to this book not out of a previously existing interest in geology or solar system science, but rather from a fascination with the Apollo program with its engineering and medical challenges. However, this led to wondering what ultimately was discovered on the moon. I then read this fine book and found it very interesting. At the time it was published, there was almost no material available in popular form on the scientific findings of Apollo and the other unmanned spaceflights to the moon so this was a pioneering work. In recent years, other books have appeared that also deal with the lunar discoveries, most notably Paul Spudis' ""The Once and Future Moon"" and David M Harland's ""Exploring the Moon"". I would have appreciated this book more if I had first read one or both of these other books because Wilhelms assumes the reader has some background in geology which was not the case with me. Once the reader gets up to speed on the basic geology which is provided in those other books, one can appreciate more the historical perspective that the author gives on how our current understanding of the Moon's past and present have developed over the last couple hundred years. In addition to the science, Wilhelms gives colorful descriptions of the major figures in lunar science including Nobel Prize Winner Harold Urey, Ralph Baldwin, Gene Shoemaker, Hal Masursky, ""Mr Moondust"" Thomas Gold, as well as the various astronauts who were recruited (sometimes unwillingly) into the lunar science fraternity. I believe that in order to understand any branch of science, it is important to see the evolution of ideas leading to our current knowledge and this book is an excellent source of information on the development of lunar science for the scientifically educated layman.
Summary 4: Whew!...You almost need to take a geology class before tackling this. Wilhems goes into great detail describing the moon from a geologists standpoint, so be prepared for that, but, the things that I took from this is that he also describes the early history of the un-manned program of lunar exploration (Ranger and Surveyor programs) in excellent detail as well as the geology history of the manned program, training and all. Obviously, the later (Apollo 15 through 17) missions are covered in more detail than the early ones, but there is something here for everyone interested in the Apollo program...just be prepared to be inundated with geology-speak."
B000N6DDRI,University Chemistry.,"Summary 1: I am in a unique position to make mention of this book. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin. I originally used this book, in unpublished form, as a freshman in Dr. Siska's course. As a senior I helped to teach from this book by holding extra help session for Dr. Siska. Since then, I have had the opportunity to teach from two other general chemistry books. Dr. Siska's University Chemistry is the most physically oriented general chemistry book you are likely to come by. His general approach allows for any budding young chemist to gain an impeccable understanding of the physical foundation of chemistry. Additionally, this text does not read like most introductory texts. Dr. Siska's humor and love for the history of science shine through. I looked back at the unpublished versions of this text many times during my undergraduate education and obtained a hard cover version as soon as I could. I highly recommend this book.
Summary 2: I was a student in Dr. Siska's Honors Chemistry course in 2003-2004. Although this book was not yet professionally published, I used Dr. Siska's self-published version. I can honestly say that I learned more from this text than any other chemistry text. The difference is that Dr. Siska forces students to solve basic Physical Chemistry problems in this book, which requires an intrinsic understanding of General Chemistry. If you can solve (and more importantly, explain) the solutions to the problems in this text, then it is more than likely that you have mastered the underlying concepts in General Chemistry I and II. I'm a huge fan and I give this book two thumbs up.
Summary 3: There was a lot of detail and information in this book, but not enough examples and the quantum mechanics section was not covered very well. probably since it would be beyond the scope of the book otherwise."
0786191538,Watch by Moonlight: Library Edition,"Summary 1: I know the poem, and I knew it before Lorena McKennit's rendering. Even though I used to listen to that CD incessantly, for some reason it didn't click with me, until the very end - I mean the END, when I turned the page and found the poem. But it was too late because I was absolutely depressed by the ending and then I read the poem and then I got this huge lump in my throat and then I wished I hadn't stayed up to finish the book.It was riveting. I don't agree with the two reviews below - the person who apparently doesn't realize Lorena McKennit didn't write the words, just put them to music, or the reader who felt the characters weren't fleshed out. In my opinion, the story was well developed, both the plot and the characters had depth, and the foundation for the finality of the story/the poem was superbly done.It took me a while to get to sleep, and that's unusual for me. I don't know if I'd read it again. I know the ending and it was too sad. I love West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet, but I won't read or watch either one of them again either.And to think I almost didn't check it out of the library. Despite the heartbreaking ending, I'd have missed a real treat.
Summary 2: I know the much loved Poem written ALFRED NOYES. It was a favourite of mine since childhood, so I was delighted when this book was given to my as a gift. It is a true homage to the essence of the poem The book is rich in detail, the revealing of the characters masterful, making them leap off the page in this a work of love.A must for anyone a favourite of the beloved poem by Noyes!!!
Summary 3: This was both good and bad. It also could have been shorter. It dragged on too much, way too much.This man is a robber and inadvertenly tells this gal Bess, who he falls in love with. So she is now complicet in his robberies. It all goes terribly wrong for these two. It also has a terribly sad ending( The young lovers both die) and then there is this really dumb poem at the end of the book. Ugh!"
0876054300,The Lovebird: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet,"Summary 1: Do not purchase a Lovebird until you read this book! This book is filled with important information. There is so much that I would have been completely ignorant to if I had not purchased this book. It helped my find the right cage, told me about dangerous toys, first aid, different species, etc. This book contains everything, if you only want to buy one book on lovebirds, make it this one. This book talks about things you would never think of, it is truly a wonderful and informative book. You can tell that the author loves lovebirds, and cares for their well-being. I am so impressed with this book, that if I decide to get another bird one day, I will turn to the same collection. I am looking forward to the arrival of my first baby lovebird, and because of this book, I feel confident and at ease that I can provide a safe and loving home for my bird.
Summary 2: A visit to my local library yielded many books about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet. This book was a lifesaver! It was thorough, as well as fun and simple to read. I am buying the Cockatiel book in the same series for a friend who owns one because this book impressed me so much!
Summary 3: If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)
Summary 4: I ordered this book because I just purchased my first Love bird. Good book, gave me pointers on how to clean, fed, and trainmy new pet. I would recommend this book to those who would like to learn about Love Bird behavior. It is easy to understand, andthere are illustrations to make you better understand. Good book!"
0811802760,Best of Bizarro (v. 1),"Summary 1: To be one of the best cartoonists, you must be capable of twisting yourself into a form that allows you to look at the world through a sequence of fun house mirrors. Dan Piraro is such a person. His cartoons present a face of the world that is always there; ordinarily it is hidden by some very effective makeup. Piraro strips off that chemical facade and shows the world as it is. You will love these cartoons, but only if you are a little bit twisted yourself.
Summary 2: Well, this is a great collection. The artwork is great, but it's the clever conceptions that make these cartoons so funny. There are no stock characters or favorite themes, every panel is original and fresh. Highly recommended.
Summary 3: Gave this book to my son at Christmas and he so enjoys the wit and humor of Bizarro! A great gift for a heavy duty fan of Bizarro!!
Summary 4: The reason I chose that title is because Dan Piraro seems to think of simple everyday things and then let loose his imagination to create these amazing comics. Just like The Far Side and Steven Wright, there are things in his books that will make you think &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot; Of course, there are also some that will make you scratch your head. All the while, you will be looking at some of the greatest comic art ever shown in a newspaper. This guy has a gift and you owe it to yourself to check out the often weird, often hilarious world created by the brain of Dan Piraro. I'm glad I did!"
0931255082,Ski Tours in the Sierra Nevada: Lake Tahoe,"Summary 1: My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded, but the route information itself is first class.
Summary 2: I had the first (1985) edition and find the second (1995) edition greatly expanded. It went from 78 to 102 tours in 167 to 256 pages. The maps are more detailed--about 2 inches per mile instead of 1 inch. I find more detailed descriptions of side trips than before.The tours are described with a mileage log instead of a narrative format. I find it easier to find where I am in this format.The only thing I would add is an index, but due to its detailedness, I still rate the book excellent and worth buying, even if you have the old edition.
Summary 3: Sufficient detail and a whole lot of information - perhaps too much information, it's a thick book - to plan ski tours, generally for lightweight touring gear, e.g. classic Nordic skis or 3-pin tele's. Alpine riders seeking vertical ft look for George Hurchalla's book."
0793823811,Basset Hounds (KW Dog),"Summary 1: This book is amazing. It is a must for Basset lovers worldwide. It has very nice photography work that is complemented by the detailed text. The author included many helpful ideas for your dog. It teaches how to breed them, how to care for them, and last but not least, how to love them. I would reccomend it to almost anyone who is interested in dogs in general or just Basset Hounds. As I Basset lover,I learned many new facts about my favorite breed, and I'm sure you would achieve the same.
Summary 2: This is a book that has a chapter on the Breed itself. Great Pictures of Bassets. And then it is a general dog Information Book.I was looking for a Book that would be much more specific about Basset Hounds and not a product catalog.
Summary 3: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets.
Summary 4: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset.

Summary 5: This is the first book I bought when I got my Basset Hound named Apple.. and I can say that it has taught me a lot in caring, loving, feeding, understading my Apple... It has all the things that u need to know about Bassets and their needs... their sorroundings... their personal stuffs, from combs, to shampoos, to perfumes, to food, to their living quarters, and most of all in everything... so, guys! go on and buy this book. It will help you understand them more!"
B0006E2VD4,The Mishomis book: The voice of the Ojibway,"Summary 1: The stories in ""The Mishomis Book"" give an excellent background for the Anishnabe culture. I have heard Anishnabe Elders refer to it as a children's bible for the Anishnabe.It begins with the origin of the Anishnabe People. It continues through many of the stories that establish the mores and society of this culture. All of these stories are written in a way children can understand.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the culture of the Woodland Indians. It has been a beginning point of understanding this culture for me and, I am certain, many others.
Summary 2: I had to buy this for a college course, and I love it so much that I won't part with it now. My kids are reading it and I think it's a great way to introduce them to Native American tradition.
Summary 3: A good review of customs of the Ojibway, written for a younger person, but readable for an adult. Especially good introduction to the culture and thought patterns of this native people. Vocabulary is well placed throughout and the entire book reads like a story.
Summary 4: This is one of my favorite books in my indigenous collection. It is beautifully decorated and well written. The book is an account of real stories and real traditions. It is not a ""fairy tale"" book. My kids love to hear me read from it and I know grown adults who smile widely when it is mentioned. A wonderful introduction to one portion of Ojibway culture!
Summary 5: The book came in good shape, it could have gotten here a little sooner but I understand Finals come first."
0376015837,Basic Plumbing (Sunset New Basic),"Summary 1: This book is an excellent instructional book for a novice/starting plumber like me, an IT/electronics person. With the excellent fundamentals, the nice and colorful drawings and the detailed step-by-step instructions, I was able to replace a p-trap, a tail piece and a strainer of a kitchen sink on my own. I attribute this first-ever accomplishment of mine to this book. The book is so simple, so informative, even a 12-year-old can do the job after a few minutes of reading. Highly recommended for aspiring plumbers. How's that for cost-saving from expensive plumbers and boosting your self-actualization and learning a new skill ?
Summary 2: This is an excellent book with tons of pictures and drawings. I am the inhouse repairman for an apartment building and this is an excellent reference manual... Should make my job much easier. Highly recomend this book.

0883685833,Journey to Hell,"Summary 1: Mr. Badman is just plain BAD. Little sins in little children get magnified into bigger and worse sins. Mr. Badman truly has every bad trait anyone could ever have. He started with lying and stealing, graduated into drinking, cheating and adultery, and then becomes a first-class hypocrite to snag himself a wealthy Christian woman for marriage. While he was sick, he cried out in false repentance only to regress as soon as he was getting well. The saddest and most touching part of the book is the death of his Christian wife and her exhortations to him and their unsaved children. From then on, it's all downhill, as Mr. Badman's seared conscience admits no light, and God gives him up to his destruction. This book has everything NOT to do if you don't want to end up like Mr. Badman. It is also very relevant with the issues of today, drunk ""driving"", planned ""parenthood"", and bankruptcy and fraud. Hot summertime reading.
Summary 2: While this book tends to deal with the individual that is completely sold out for sin, there are things that every Christian will be able to identify with. John Bunyan deals with the fact that sin is sin, no matter what lable any given society has given it.While I thank the Almighty Sovereign God for showing me my need for a savior, and for granting me the priviledge of repenting when I did, I must admit that my heart was very sorrowful and heavy as I read this book. By reading of Badman's extreme antics and his propensity for developing new methods of sin, I must admit that I saw things in my regenerated being that relate to Mr. Badman in one way or another. This is NOT a good thing to identify with, however, I feel that it is a tool that God is using in order to show me my continued need for help from above.While this book is ficticious in it's characters, the truths that come blazing forth from the scenarios are deep and penetrating. This is a book that should be read often. This is a book that forces the reader to bare his soul before the Creator. Thank God for men like Bunyan.Do yourself a favor, O comfortable Christian......Read this book and pray that God will allow you to be honest with your assessment of your current condition.Steven D. Draa
Summary 3: Even though this book was written in 1600's, it remained very pratical, even up to today. It talked about how a young boy rejecting the calling of God and became a chief in evil workings. And see how God gave him up to vile illusion. Truly a God inspired book.
Summary 4: If you loved Bunyan's ""Pilgrim's Progress"" and you yearn for more, then ""Journey to Hell"" is the volume for you. John Bunyan (1628 1688) was born England, preached in Lower Samsell and spent time in prison for his faith. His marvelous pen produced:- The Holy City- Pilgrims' Progress- Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners- The Holy War- Visions of Heaven and Hell- And this outstanding volume.Herein Bunyan presents a fascinating allegory as the main character, Mr. Badman, is a wicked miscreant hell-bent of living for sin. He's depraved and immersed in the lusts of the flesh, wickedness, depravity, and carnality. His profligacy is compared with the moral law and the fruit of the Spirit as the right way to live is made clear while trusting in Christ alone for eternal salvation. It's uplifting and edifying to ponder the life of Mr. Wiseman who lives for God and strives to please the Lord.Chapters in this stirring volume include:- A bad boy- Tricks of the wicked businessman- The sin of pride- A Christian's death- A quiet, hardened death- The Final judgment- And Excellent Extras: The sayings of John Bunyan and the Life of John Bunyan.Bunyan says: ""If you have sinned, do not lie down without repentance; for the want of repentance after one has sinned makes the heart yet harder and harder.""This powerful work will help you discover How to:- find true joy in difficult conditions- avoid the dire results of sin and profligacy- instruct your children in the ways of God and how they can avoid evil- be secure in Christ and find pardon from God s judgment- And moreThis was originally published as ""The Life and Death of Mr. Badman"" (271 pages).There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies"
1562921614,Tozer's Little Instruction Book (Christian Classics Series),"Summary 1: This book is a good introduction to the thoughts of A.W. Tozer, an influential pastor in Chicago. The format of the book makes it easy to carry in a purse or pocket. Each page has a title, a quote from Tozer, and a related Bible verse. It would make a great gift for a young person, a person seeking spiritual guidance, a seeker, or someone wanting to know more about Christianity. The layout is decorative and attractive. It would be a good gift for someone in a hospital or nursing home or who needs encouragement. Each page has a digestible devotional theme. I like such books for times when I need a quick word of wisdom during a rushed day, or to keep by my bedside for a last devotional thought each day.Here is one sample page: &quot;Trust and Obey. Salvation apart from obedience is unknown in the sacred Scriptures.(Tozer) Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. 1 John 3:24.&quot;In Touch Ministries has a profile on Tozer from which I quote: &quot;Although A. W. Tozer died in 1963, his life and spiritual legacy continue to draw many into a deeper knowledge of God. Tozer walked a path in his spiritual life that few attempt, characterized by a relentless and loving pursuit of God. He longed to know more about the Savior-how to serve and worship Him with every part of his being.Throughout his life and ministry, Tozer called believers to return to an authentic, biblical position that characterized the early church-a position of deep faith and holiness. &quot;He belonged to the whole church,&quot; says James Snyder in the book, In Pursuit of God: The Life Of A. W. Tozer. &quot;He embraced true Christianity wherever he found it.&quot;During his lifetime, Tozer pastored several Christian and Missionary Alliance churches, authored more than forty books, and served as editor of Alliance Life, the monthly denominational publication for the C&amp;MA. At least two of Tozer's books are considered spiritual classics, The Pursuit of God and The Knowledge of the Holy-a tremendous accomplishment for a man who never received a formal theological education. The presence of God was his classroom. His notebooks and tools consisted of prayer and the writings of early Christians and theologians-the Puritans and great men of faith.&quot;As a pastor, I've found that many people will not read a lengthy book of theology, but perhaps with such an introduction to this man, they may pick up another of Tozer's books.
Summary 2: This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this.
Summary 3: I am bothered by the review from dn@microtek.fr. Everyone has a right to his own opinion, but I think this is just vicious anti-Christian retoric. Mr. Tozer is a prolific writer and has several 5 star ratings. Please see the &quot;All Books&quot; list before judging this book only by what this man says.
Summary 4: This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time. This one ended up straight in the bin. To me it is worse than pure secularism and borders on blasphemy! It's sick!"
0897501292,Advanced Dynamic Kicks (Literary Links to the Orient),"Summary 1: Advanced Kicks is a must have for any Fan or Student (past,present,or future) of Sifu Cynthia Rothrock.It has a very good and easy to follow format. However...like ANY instructional book or video...... it is only a guide to actual training with a Qualified instructor. One could get &quot;Hurt&quot; trying to do some of the stretches or kicking drills without the proper warmup.What would make this book complete is if it were to have a Video package.I own a copy (*1st printing)of this book and use it as a reference manual at my Martial Arts Studio.*A note to Collectors. This book has two printings. Both printings are pretty much the same. The difference is the &quot;price&quot; on the back cover.
Summary 2: This book does a good job of motivating me to keep to my cardio kickboxing class. Even if there are more other good books on martial arts kicking in print. I collect such kind of books. Keep up the good work.
Summary 3: Chung and Rothrock are legends. Great martial artists with duly earned fame. Their book is a beautiful presentation of the most aesthetic of kicks, therefore underscoring form and high kicking. It is also tilted in my opinion towards the Korean interpretation of kicking where aesthetics and flexibility are kings. This book is nice and I think a must have for the collecting kicking enthusiast. I do not consider it a reference work, because much too eclectic and not really practical.
Summary 4: por favor no gaste su dinero en este pesimo y mediocre libro,,lo unico que la mujer y el chino hacen es mostrar su impresionante flexibilidad,pero nada mas,,no aportan tecnicas reales ni explicaciones para llegar a ese estado.me parece mas bien que los autores lo que quieren es que la gente sepa que ellos tienen una super-flexibilidad impresionante.este es solamente un librito y nada mas,, muy,,muy pero muy mediocre"
B000857LO0,"Pain, sex and time;: A new outlook on evolution and the future of man,","Summary 1: I would actually give this book 3.5 stars. The only reason I'm not giving it more stars is that the concepts regarding the evolution of the spiritual man, though still retaining some validity, seem somehow outmoded. In addition, the writing style is a bit anachronistic. However the author was remarkable for his time (which was not all that long ago) and he is still very much worth reading. He was an underrated, somewhat eclectic philosopher who was courageous enough to question the scientism of his day.
Summary 2: This is a book by Gerald Heard. Catchy title, no?The book starts off rather well. It proposes that man must make the next step in evolution - mental/expanded consciousness - or degenerate or destroy himself. Note that Heard wrote this around the start of WWII.The pain and sex in the title has to do with excess energy present for doing this next step that we are failing at doing, hence problems with these. The time part is that it is an illusion - not much done with this that I noticed. He seems to say that when we are intellectually occupied, we are less worried about sex, have less sensitivity to pain and are not as aware of time - he may be on to something here.Heard then reviews history (including evolutionary history of life) to shown that his points have merit. There are some interesting items here.Things get a little sketchy and hard to follow near the end - even his sentence structure gets hard to follow - when he starts talking about how to achieve the next step. His method is hard to explain, but it based on explicit effort in special communities. Apparently, he even attempted to found one in California in the 1940's which did not catch on - this is not to say that his ideas were wrong.Heard was a rather interesting character - see the biographical information in the book. He was friends with Huxley and involved in the Vedanta Society. Meditation was very important to him in later life.Worth a read, but be prepared to trudge through some rough spots, especially towards the end. The summary at the very end is fairly informative about the book as a whole.I had very high hopes when I started it, but kind of lost them in many respects as I finished it.
Summary 3: Humankind is doomed or will destroy itself unless some radical countermeasure is found. Unlike other biological creatures whose evolution has stopped we have still reserves of unspent biological energy. The proof for this can be seen in how we experience pain, and in the peculiarities of our sexual behavior. So, we are capable of evolution. The pace of evolution has quickened enormously, further human evolution will be not biological but psychological. To characterize this the term ""enlargement of consciousness"" is used; in a great part this means attaining mystical experiences and supernormal psychic powers. Attaining this state of consciousness should be the new goal of mankind.These are very shortly the basic ideas of Mr Heard's book. He continues to design, in broad terms, the practical way of achieving such a goal. Shortly, he proposes the creation of voluntary communes totally dedicated to it. There is also a short review of the history of human mystical experience (maybe the most interesting part of the book). One remark here: Mr Heard seems to be overenthusiastic with what concerns the spiritual development of the Jewish Essene community and early Christian gnostics. Was their religion really non-anthropomorphic as he seems to think?Mr Heard tried to realize his ideals. He failed, like so many idealists before. Which does not mean that these were not worthy ideas. Perhaps the practical steps should have been different.Long, winding sentences make the book somewhat difficult to read, until you get used to them. (Was this kind of style fashionable before WWII?) Not all the ideas presented are convincing, particularly those concerning evolution. Nevertheless, Mr Heard's mission is that of a pioneer. One of his troubles is that his goal is very difficult to describe. ""The enlargement of consciousness"" is good but very general. The same vagueness applies to the possible methods of moving towards it. He is feeling his way towards an unclear goal in an unknown land, therefore his language is, out of necessity, also quite general, perhaps not always very clear.All in all, it was not a very interesting reading, except for some parts on history. But it certainly raises the right questions like the following: why do we have such an enormous discrepancy between the ever more powerful means in our possession (science, technology) and the negligibility of our ends (material well-being - yes, but... is this all, gentlemen?).
Summary 4: A brilliant review of the social, psychological and spiritual state of Western culture just before it dived into the cataclysm of WWII."
B000GJLNDI,Your Engineered House,"Summary 1: This 1964 book is a testament to the individual's ability to imagine and build one's own home. It is a book to be inspired by. I read the book while overseas and immediately became convinced that I could build my own home. After retirement, my wife and I did just that, with great success. Do not buy this book thinking that it will provide explicit directions. The engineering is old and often outdated. Read it rather as an evocative tribute to human ingenuity and ability. This should not be your last book on building design, but it might very well be your best first book.
Summary 2: You know how tradesmen can often tell you the specifics of what they think you should do to a building but not the conceptual basis of those decisions? This book is very helpful in understanding underlying concerns when you build, like how water travels, and where and when it causes rot and damage. Also how to achieve solar gain and how you lose heat through radiation, convection and... what was the third? Oh well, it's in the book. Also how to plan for ventilation, and how you can use fixed glass. There is even brand new reflective insulation that reputedly works the way Roberts hoped tin foil would work.Besides that, the author writes in a clear and amusing style.I'm trying to rebuild a cabin made from a travel trailer and a one car garage. Believe it or not, I found this book in the library of the Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC. It has really helped me understand what problems I need to address in order to succeed at this project and to get the most for the money I put into it. The book has even made the heinous crawl space I'm insulating now more understandable and managable. I love it.
Summary 3: REX ROBERTS was a mechanical engineer who realized that ifhe wanted to have a home livable and cheap, so he wouldn'towe the bank all his life, he 1)has to choose the right womanfor his wife, and 2)engineer his home to eliminate the wastefullbuilding and design practices of the trade..He excelled in design thought, and failed in use of materials. Hewas, after all, a mechanical engineer in the time of cheap utilities(gas and oil and electricity- oil was $2.00 a barrel)In reality, in 1964, any home insulation against heat loss wasconsidered a waste of money.Rex Roberts goosed the thought process of any person who wanted to dosomething for themself. Whole Earth Catalog did the same thing.Rex Roberts was unjustly criticised by another author of alternativedesigns who apparently was crushed under one of his unconventionaldesigns when it collapsed.Rex Robert's design ideas would work if the owner used friends in tradesto actually build the home. Keep in mind the concept ""AFFORDABLE""AND THE CONCEPT: NO BANK LOAN.I DID IT BECAUSE OF REX ROBERTS. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE MY AGE WHOHAS.KEEP IN MIND THE INTRODUCTION: IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A HOUSE YOU CANLIVE IN CHEAP AND STILL HAVE A NICE HOME, FIRST YOU HAVE TO PICKTHE PROPER WIFE""ALL THE REVIEWERS MISS THIS MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE.SS/RICARDS FLORA"
0842382860,Hands across the Moon,"Summary 1: Review by Gigi HoffmanMia and Gretchen are best friends, excited to start their junior year of high school together in sunny California...until Gretchen and her family move to Ecuador. Gretchen is brokenhearted--she resents Ecuador, none of her clothes or stuff has arrived yet, and the rest of her family loves it. To makes things worse, she doesn't speak any Spanish and is a total outsider at her new school.On the other hand, Mia is bored at home by her typical routine. All she does is go to school, church, the gym (she's an Olympic-hopeful gymnast), and help out at her mom's store. Isn't there more to life than that?The two share their struggles, laughs, pain, and experiences through letters to each other, even if they are half a world away.Meyer does a great job of setting up Gretchen and Mia. I felt like I was right there with them while they talked about everything through their letters. If you've ever had a friend move away and tried to keep in touch through letters, or even if you haven't, check this book out.
Summary 2: I happen to love books written completely in letter format, so I enjoyed ""Hands Across the Moon."" It's the story of two friends who are separated during their junior year because one of them must move to Ecuador with her family. The book documents their year apart through the letters that they use to keep in touch with. I am not so sure everything that happens is COMPLETELY realistic, but it is realistic enough.The only thing I would say that I didn't like was not enough information was given about the characters' families. There isn't much detail--but that makes the letters real. At the end of the book, I found myself wondering what happened next.I think it's worth the read.
Summary 3: Hello to start with i can say this was a present from my best friend when my dad got transferred from our home country. I started reading this on the way to our dads transferred place. i could say i was literally in tears as it is about two friends who are separated with the same situation as ours. It was really touching. I totally loved the book and i even have it in kindle reading it all the time when i miss my friends. It reminds us of our high school. I'm not ready to comment on the writing style of the author or anything because this book was just way too over whelming with sentiments that it really dint matter much. This book is something that i would like to be kept treasured. i Hope everyone else who misses their best buddies would feel the same.
Summary 4: A well-done book showing the trials and joy, and most of all the energy of teenage girls. The use of the letter-witing medium adds to the appeal, making the communications between the two main characters real and immediate."
0816514445,Bighorse the Warrior,"Summary 1: Tiana Bighorse is my grandmother's aunt and the Bighorse of the title is my great-great grandfather. I love this book. It was such a find for me to finally read it. I do not speak Navajo being half Navajo and half Nakota Sioux, so this story was never told to me. And anyway, during short visits to my grandparents no one ever had time to talk this away about our family history. I love it that Noel strove to retain Tiana's voice. My grandmother, her niece, cannot actually speak English as does her aunt, so it was neat to see what she might sound like if she actually did speak the language I do! All in all a real treasure. True, it does not go into great detail about the horrors of the Long Walk, but I loved some of the nuggets of wisdom she passes down from my long-gone grandfather. One is how he urged, like a modern psychologist that survivors of the Long Walk (he did not walk it himself, but fought as a guerilla fighter against the Americans) talk about their pain and losses. So many kept it inside them and it killed them. I also love her message to the young Navajo people about how this Navajo homeland was not &quot;given&quot; to us but it was fought for and people died and suffered for. My family now lives in Cameron on the Western side of the reservation, but when I drove across the vast Dinetah, which is the size of Ireland or W. Virginia, it gave me a great feeling of pride to know my family had lived all over that land. From Mt. Taylor, where Bighorse is originally raised, to Navajo Mountain where he lived as a guerilla warrior and finally in the Tuba City area, where my mom's family live now. The best quote from the book and I am paraphrasing is what Big Horse told her about being a warrior, a warrior is the one who is still walking around, tending to the sick when everyone else is down. This is such a Navajo sentiment. My aunts and uncles are always urging me to stand up, keep moving, wake up early. And implicit in that urging is the belief that we all have the ability to access our inner strengths for the benefit of those we hold dearest to us.
Summary 2: This is a pretty good book. The main focus is on the struggle of the Navajo people against the United States government. Tiana Bighorse's stories about her father that he told her make up this book's chapters. The stories are interesting and do a good job explaining the Navajo plight. The stories include fighting, running away, terrible atrocities commited by our government, and the struggle of her father and other warriors. On the whole the book is interesting and informative.
Summary 3: I've met the author - Tiana Bighorse Butler. Her pride shines through as she tells the stories of her father. Written in Navajo english, the reader is taken into the traditional navajo way of life. Wonderful stories give an honest perspective and a clear understanding of warriors in that point of time. Buy this book!! Compelling reading that you'll never forget!!
Summary 4: The topic which this book covers, the oppression of the Apache Indians by the American Government, particularly the Long Walk, is an amazing story of struggle and brutal oppression. However, this story, an account of the events from a family memeber of Big Horse the Warrior, leaves the reader feeling a little slighted. Very little detail of the horrific events is given and worse yet, the events end up sounding watered down, as if they really weren't that bad.Overall, I feel the historical event of tragic proportion deserves a much better account which brings the readers into the emotional aura surrounding the events."
0671750437,Grammar for Smart People: Your User-Friendly Guide to Speaking and Writing Better English,"Summary 1: Though this book is on grammar, it is not that hard. It tries to make the subject simple, fun, and the most important thing, easy to remember.You'll need to make a review of some grammar, but the book is self-contained to that purpose, and it gives you all necessary tools for the work. These tools will help you to understand how to write and speak better English, and if they were not enough for you, every &quot;rule&quot; has examples and these examples, in turn, are explained when needed.The book recognizes English is a changing language, so there are exceptions for some rules, but it shows you the most general exceptions and helps you to decide which road you should take.Nonnative English speakers, beware: The book has &quot;fun parts&quot; that could be difficult to understand. If you are not an intermediate or advanced speaker of English, better look for another book.For Spanish speakers:este es un buen libro para practicar y aprender gram&aacute;tica inglesa, pero est&aacute; orientado a hablantes nativos del idioma, no a estudiantes. Si no est&aacute;n en un nivel avanzado, otro libro puede ser mejor.
Summary 2: This book took the confusion out of High School English class. Everyone who uses the written English language should invest in this book. It's easy to understand and fun to read.
Summary 3: As an English teacher who has worked with community college, adult education, high school, and international students, I recommend this thin, practical book.In less than 200 pages, Grammar for Smart People introduces and reviews the essential grammar points that we should know and sometimes forget. ESL students will also find it clear, direct, and useful. This thin book also contains more real information than many far more expensive, thick, and mandated college textbooks. It's far superior and cheaper than the vastly over-rated Betty Azar series for English language learners or the many other drill and kill textbooks imposed on too many vocational education and community college students.If you want an affordable, portable, and practical grammar guide, buy this Grammar for Smart People.
Summary 4: I was hoping that the title meant: ""Advanced grammar and its more arcane forms""What it truly meant was: ""Normal grammar text with a supercilious and pompous title""My father was always strict about grammar as I grew up, and rather growing a dislike for it, I fell in love with words and word play. I became the type of person who would argue the merits of the Oxford Comma and wonder about bound root morphemes with friends. I fantasize about owning my own copy of the OED. I wanted a book to review the more difficult and erudite aspects of English grammar. The title intrigued me, but failed to live up to my expectations. This is a fairly rudimentary treatment of grammar. I've seen better, and I've seen worse. Not a purchase I regret, but do not expect anything beyond the standard grammar text that attempts to be interesting.
Summary 5: I love this book! I taught grammar and composition on the college level, and my students paid over $80 for a textbook. Had I known about this book, I'd have had them use it; and I could have supplemented instruction. It's a wonderful resource, right next to the thesaurus and dictionary. I know all that information is available on line, but sometimes it's just not worth the search time when the book is right at hand."
0747249008,Only Child,"Summary 1: My first encounter with Jack Ketchum's work was reading his novel 'Red'. A somewhat slim book, I finished reading it in one day. You know if a book is going to be worthwhile usually after the first couple of chapters, and the time spent reading 'Red' was thoroughly worthwhile. It still remains one of the best pieces of fiction I have encountered, which brings me to ...... 'Only Child'.Like 'Red', this novel is fairly slim. But that is as it should be. There is no room for wasted words in Jack's writing. He gets to the point quickly and effectively, inviting his readers into a nightmare journey - a mixture of fiction and reality. It is exactly this juxtaposition of taboo realism and carefully crafted fictional characters that lends Jack's writing its uniqueness. He deals with the cruelty and evil inherent in society, bringing such issues to the surface, almost as if he is attempting to release his anger by way of writing.Violence in 'Only Child' is extreme and, at times, graphically depicted. In this way, the novel can be likened to Richard Laymon's work. But there is nothing supernatural about this book. Jack's horror is about the experiences some people suffer everyday of their lives - people who want to escape from their tormentors but are too terrified to take a stand, because of the consequences should they fail. Lydia McCloud, however, does make a stand.Married to the fraudulently good-natured Arthur Danse, Lydia soon discovers his dark side. For Danse does not adhere to the rules of society. Undoubtedly disturbed, Danse believes he is here for a reason ... to ensure that he teaches humankind that both fear and pain are necessary, and that he has been chosen to inflict such pain on anyone who refuses his demands. His disturbing behaviour is not limited to the unfortunate people he encounters outside his family - rather it is Lydia and his young son, Robert, who are most at risk.Jack Ketchum has created two strikingly different characters here. Lydia is imbued with inner strength, a giving nature, and an understanding of what really counts in life. Arthur Danse is cruel, calculating, and possesses a relentless determination to both control and hurt people.The message behind this book is that good can triumph over evil if the victim is able summon enough courage to face their tormentor. 'Only Child' takes a realistic and accurate view of domestic violence and child abuse. It explores the psychological aspects of such abuse from the viewpoint of both antagonist (Danse) and protagonists (Lydia, Robert, and anyone else who, along the way, dares to question Arthur Danse).I once knew a mother and daughter who were subjected to physical and psychological violence and abuse within a domestic environment, and can therefore relate to this story.'Only Child' should be remebered alongside Thomas Harris's 'Silence of the Lambs' as one of the best psychological thrillers of violence ever written. Jack's writing is both dark and powerful; his subject matter disturbing yet insightful. Certainly unforgettable.Along with 'Only Child', I reccomend you try other works by Jack Ketchum, especially 'Red', 'Road Kill' (a.k.a 'Joyride'), 'Offspring', 'Off Season', 'The Girl Next Door', and the phenomenal 'A Right to Life'.
Summary 2: I'd like to deduct a star from this rating...but it wouldn't be fair. Based upon the novel Ketchum meant to write -- based upon a true story, it turns out -- it's hard to criticize a word here. Ketchum is a good writer, and, I believe, wrote exactly the book he intended to. It's a solid, effective thriller.My only hesitation lies in the expectations I brought to the book. I haven't read a lot of Ketchum's work, and was excited to leap into this one. I expected a horrific ride, based upon Ketchum's hard core reputation. And it WAS horrific, but also somewhat restrained, probably owing to Ketchum's desire to be faithful to his source incidents. Fully half of the novel takes place in a court room -- intense matters are being considered, but the incidents themselves are, for the most part, off-camera. I admire Ketchum's restraint, but it didn't completely jibe with the ""pull no punches"" reputation I'd heard about.Also -- with a couple chapters to go, I saw a twist ending coming, and it was a doozy. I was already getting impressed by Ketchum's clever manipulations. The only trouble is -- it never happened. The real ending was pretty straightforward, again probably owing to the ""real world"" incidents he was documenting. Again, not fair to deduct points for that, but moderately disappointing as a reader.Anyway, the book Ketchum actually did write -- it's a first rate thriller, and I would recommend it to any fan of the genre.
Summary 3: I'll keep this short. I've read all of Ketchum's novels. This is, hands down, his best. I'm confused as to why, as movies have been pitched and produced, this one hasn't been considered. I also feel this one deserves a sequel. The previous reviews have said it all, so I don't want to be redundant.
Summary 4: Gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves the book as he is a big Jack Ketchum fan.
Summary 5: This is, without a doubt, Jack Ketchum's best book so far. It grabs hold in the beginning and takes the reader on a terrifying ride. There really isn't any more to add to the previous reviewers comments since they've perfectly described it"
1581125917,Seduce Me! How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion,"Summary 1: &quot;Seduce Me&quot; is primarily a book about sexuality between couples. Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. &quot;Seduce Me&quot; is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire.
Summary 2: After reading ""Seduce Me! How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion"", I immediately made arrangements to purchase an initial order of 50 copies for our medical office. Through our patient-centered obstetrics and gynecology practice, we treat thousands of women annually and receive questions and concerns about sexual libido daily.I found this book to be very informative, presenting scientific biochemical data and psychological insights in a manner that any of our patients could easily comprehend.Beyond that, the recommendations offer clear and fun solutions, addressing both sexual and relationship issues. I would estimate that 1 in 4 women I see daily ask me about problems with sexual desire and fulfillment, and I am very pleased to be able to provide ""Seduce Me!"" to them as an excellent and enjoyable resource.
Summary 3: Why does he fall asleep on the couch, rather than coming to bed? Why does she so often have a headache? What happened to the spark of electricity that was there when you just started seeing each other? Where is the passion?It isn't really gone. It might be hidden under levels of stress or lost among the maddeningly packed calendar of events, but it can be re-sparked. The key is to look into the whys of the roadblocks to the bedroom. Clear those up and you will be free to proceed down the highway of intimacy again.With a background in health care management and business consulting, it is clear that Darcy Cole is a problem solver who cares about the problem! Applying scientific research, anecdotal evidence and yes, personal experience to the development of ""Seduce Me!"", Darcy has completed a guide that offers advice and clear speaking factual information that answers the many questions we all have. Like ""Why am I not in the mood?"" and ""How can I get my partner interested in sex again?""With understanding of a roadblock we can plan to take a detour. Understanding a reluctance to release inhibitions is the answer to overcoming them. Men will come away knowing what a woman needs to get into the mood and women will understand what makes the male brain tick. You might learn something about yourself too!Darcy clearly explains the differences in male and female arousal systems while providing keen insight to the mental beast as well. The mysteries are explained here. But that's not all! Darcy offers some remedies for those situations you have just learned about. She even gives a whole chapter of Seduction Scene Strategies and explains why they work. If all of that isn't enough for you, Ms. Cole offers a generous list of additional resources.This title should be a mandatory gift for every wedding couple, every 50th anniversary and every couple undergoing the mundane tasks of living.
Summary 4: The pages seemed to turn themselves! One minute I was embarking into Chapter One, and shortly later I found myself turning the last page with a satisfied ""Hmmm..."".Seduce Me! is a book I'd freely recommend to any couple who wants to restore the ""sugar and spice"" to their relationship. Whether dating, engaged, or involved long-term, Seduce Me! can help couples retain and renew that ""new love"" passion.I found this book throughly researched and rich with useful information. The host of included role-playing scenes provide an imaginative and provocative spark, sure to have couples racing home from work and eager for ""playtime"". The text was easy to follow, and was presented in a ""meat and potatoes"" style without the use of flab to merely add pages.It's clear that Darcy has done her homework. I'll be keeping this handy and helpful reference nearby.Donald L. HicksUnderstanding the G-Spot and Female Sexuality
Summary 5: THIS book really helps to explain what is in a woman's heart and mind. The constant pressure to keep the household running smoothly and taking care of everyone else's needs leaves little time for my needs. Thank you for writing what I could never explain to my husband."
0843924837,Spawn of Hell,"Summary 1: A mad scientist teams up with a greedy conglomerate to create an indestructible killing species via recombinant DNA experimentation. They unleash and test these ""Spawn of Hell"" on unsuspecting small town residents. These beings are butt-ugly gruesome, have a real taste for human flesh and there's an interesting twist in their make-up. Horror fans will be thrilled.The main character, David Hammond, is a down on his luck, 30-something artist still hoping for his big break. He's a dark but interesting and likeable character, however, his pairing with Anna Braddon hit a real sour note for me. The passages focusing on their relationship brings the story to a complete standstill. Anna, a supermodel no less, just does not exhibit any qualities (besides her appearance) that would explain David's fierce attraction to her. She is a badly drawn character, which prevented me from rating the book as five-star excellent. Otherwise it's an originally executed, fun, fast read.
Summary 2: All his horror seems to be tour de forces, and SPAWN OF HELL is no different. The character of David Hammond is far from boring as other reviewers say; indeed, he's one of the most realistically drawn characters in any horror novel and is a perfect main protagonist. The depression and bad situation he begins the book in shows that horror can be found in everyday life, not just with mysterious ravenous beasts. His relationship with Anna is well-depicted, growing believably through the course of the novel. As always in a Schoell book, the supporting and even minor characters are well fleshed out, especially Harry London. Frederick Anton, the main human villain, is perhaps a bit two-dimensional, but it works.But oh, what monsters! Maybe they don't appear on-page enough for some readers, but I found that keeping them hidden and lurking for much of the action increased their terror, to make them all the more frightening for the times they did jump out. The ""full reveal"" when we finally learn just what they're made of and what they look like is chillingly done, as is their main rampage, and a close-combat scene between one and David inside a car, while he struggles to keep it from killing Anna or making her lose control of the vehicle, is as intense as it gets.My only complaint is that the ending is a bit abrupt; the plot is resolved, and then the book ends. No real seeing how the humans react and relax and so on. But that's only minor.As always, Schoell gets a high recommendation.
Summary 3: Sure it's the typical genetic mutations on the loose horror novel, but the creatures themselves are actually pretty inventive and are so far the first in a book that made me feel a little ookie when picturing them, so in that department it's a step above most. However, compared to the rest of the story the amount of monster action is lacking. Most of the book centers on the main characters trying to decide if they are truly in love or not. Easily 50 - 100 pages could have been dropped to make this a tighter more compact and enjoyable read, but instead it tends to drag and shift its focus on the disinteresting thoughts of the main characters far too much. Character developement is fine, but in this case instead of developement things are stuck on repeat. Overall, yes, I liked the book, but more editing should have been done.
Summary 4: Lets see...two strangers visit a small town and soon come face to face with an evil presence that is killing off the locals. Where have we seen this plot before? In plenty of other horror novels, of course. To be fair, &quot;Spawn of Hell&quot; isn't any worse than those made for TV horror movies you often see on Sci-Fi channel. In fact, it was probably the inspiration for a few of them.
Summary 5: I loved this book as a kid. When I finally found it on here, I ordered it right away!!It is a good book (but this is not a book review).Arrived in good condition, quickly and cheap."

1593303459,Era: The Dawn of a New Age,"Summary 1: Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book.
Summary 2: This book is a fun read. I spotted a whole of three typos. The events a fast-paced and there is a surprising twist at the end.Especially useful is the compendeum of dinosaurs referenced throughout the book. A must-read for any who love dinosaurs - especially recommended young teens
Summary 3: This book is an entertaining read, but it does seem like the author took a decade to write it, and then a day to proof it. Grammar and spelling errors are fairly common, which I'll blame on the lack of an editor.When the book has dinosaurs or the three main human characters as protagonists, it's going somewhere, and doing it quite well. Andredea, Ham, and Josh are good people, with flaws, emotions that take the better of them at times, and moments of stunning heroism. The dinosaurs...you can't help with being emphatic towards. The early chapter following the life and death of a Compsognathus was really moving.Then there's the sticky parts. The book somewhat suffers from trying to spin too many plates at once. This affects the book, negatively, in two ways.One is that the USA is dealing with three major global catastrophes simultaneously. This over-complication of things doesn't affect the situation for any of the protagonists (majorly), it just introduces an unnecessary global component to the book. This book never needed to introduce the president and vice president of the United States.Two is that there already were a lot of plates spinning before two additional major global catastrophes were introduced into the book, that seem to be completely forgotten about. Like 150+ people who were passengers on a plane that just...sorta disappears as a subplot.And the ending kicks you in the face and is a (pardon me, Pantera) vulgar display of power.This is the author's first book, and I believe he can write well, but Era might be a case where his dreams were too big to put down into words. With editing and a sharper focus, his future work could be great."
0849902010,"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 2, Genesis 16-50 (wenham) 556pp","Summary 1: There is no question that this is one of the best commentaries on Genesis today. This commentary is one of the essential starting places for research on Genesis. His interaction with critical views is thorough, though if you have a problem with all forms of source criticism, you will definitely find yourself disagreeing with him in many places.However, Wenham is no skeptic. Many times in both volumes he points out places which clearly point to the antiquity of the text. He clearly holds a high view of the historicity of Genesis, as can be seen in his interpretation of the mention of camels in the patriarchal narrative (he sees them as a 2nd millennium luxury, rather than a historical anachronism). There is also extensive comment on the broader literary dimensions of Genesis, such as palistrophic and panelled structures, which highly suggests, at the very least, a high degree of editorial activity, so as to make source/form/traditio-historical analysis virtually irrelevant, and you get the sense that Wenham is on board here. I can't think of a single place where he allows source criticism to derail his exegesis. He clearly is treating the canonical version.The only place that conservative readers may find troubling is in his treatment on ""The Religion of the Patriarchs."" If you are familiar with his other work, you know what I'm talking about. Wenham believes that there is good evidence that Yahweh of the Old Testament was earlier worshipped as El, head of the Canaanite Pantheon. One line of argument he uses, for example, is that Baal eventually replaced El, and is presented in the Bible as one of Yahweh's big ""contenders."" In this respect, he is very similar to F.M. Cross.When all is said and done, however, Wenham is definitely a 5-star commentary. The good pastor/student understands that he must read critically, not swallowing, hook-line-and-sinker, everything is put in front of him. Nevertheless, both volumes by Wenham are well worth the money you pay for them, and will pay for themselves in edification and knowledge gained.
Summary 2: No doubt Wenham and Hamilton have written the best conservative's commentary on Genesis. Longman said that ""between Wenham and Hamilton, Genesis is well covered.""But to have both means you must buy 4 volumes because both Wenham and Hamilton separated their commentaries on Genesis into two volumes (Wenham: Genesis 1-15 & 16-50; Hamilton: Genesis 1-17 & 18-50).I have read all of the four volumes and found that for the first part of Genesis, Hamilton tend to be more conservative than Wenham (e.g. compared their interpretations on the ""spirit"" in Gen. 1:2), but for the second part Wenham has given me more insight (He always can find fresh meanings and applications from the famous Christian stories that I have been reading since I was in the sunday school!).My suggestion is if you have enough money buy all, but if you don't buy the first book of Hamilton and the second book of Wenham.
Summary 3: Great Technical/Critical Commentary.A little heavy on Source Criticism and weak on the possibility of Mosaic Authorship.Does a great job of handling Hebrew and Literary structure.A must have for the Scholar/Pastor."
1560373008,Lives of Grizzlies: MT & WY,"Summary 1: As the wife of Jim Cole, I can tell you that he has dedicated three (3) decades of his life to the study of Grizzly Bears in their natural habitats. His books took three (3) years to write and spotlight bear families from the lower 48 and Alaska which he has followed for years. Jim gave up a lucrative real estate career to pursue his wildlife passion and has made many sacrifices along the way. As a result of the most recent attack on May 23rd, 2007, Jim is now permanently blind in one eye. Ironically, Jim never considered himself to be a professional photographer. He counts himself as a Grizzly Bear Educator and performs original songs about bears to a wide range of audiences. Jim's books represent his life's work and offer useful insight into the cunning versatility of the great bear. As of the writing of this review, Jim has never been banned from any national park nor have his actions resulted in the death of any bruin. Simply stated, Jim believes these creatures to be the most intelligent and impressive animals on Planet Earth! Yes, his time spent in the backcountry is quite non-traditional; but Jim always was a rugged individualist.
Summary 2: Jim Cole is a talented photographer and writer. With a keen sense of observation Cole documents in a stunning way with pictures and word his observation of the grizzlies that roam our great National Parks. Together with his book on Grizzlies in Alaska the reader can gain an indepth and personal insight into the lives of these magnificent animals.
Summary 3: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself.
Summary 4: As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters.
Summary 5: Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins,"" by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?"
0878916997,AP Spanish w/ Audio CDs (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the AP Exam (Advanced Placement (AP) Test Preparation),"Summary 1: I really enjoyed using this book as a form of supplementary preparation for taking the AP Spanish Exam. I found it to be an excellent source of information for all of the material covered on the exam, and some of the practices excercises actually more than prepared me for the material on the exam. The audio CDs were essential in preparing me for the oral component of the exam, and made studying more fun. I Am grateful to the authors of the book, since their work helped me to score a 5 on the exam. I would strongly recommend this book to test takers.
Summary 2: First, I should say that I didn't actually use the book as a review, but my teacher did use two of the practice exams (not sure how many come with it in total) in class. We did one full length exam on a Saturday morning (I got a 5) and there was another one that we did in sections over a few days. This morning, I took the real College Board AP Spanish Language exam and it was a little different. Not completely different, mind you-REA got all of the basics right-but something about the tone and feel of the exam was different. The reading passages weren't actual narratives, but factual writings, two of them were reprinted from newspapers. On the listening section all of the accents in this book were from Spain (use of &quot;ceceo&quot;) but none of them were on the actual test. This isn't a bad test, but some of the other review books are probably a little better. Again, I did not use this for review of grammar or look at the book at all, just the practice tests.
Summary 3: I have a large collection of books for learning spanish and this book turned out to be one of the very best of them. I know that it is a book angled toward preparing students for the AP exam butit just so happens to be one of the most user friendly, well designed and comprehensive books for learning spanish out on the market today. I am an advanced college spanish student and therefor I didn't get the book to prepare for the exam. I got it because it offers a well structured and comprehensive review as well as many helpful drills and practice tests. I think a book structured like this is probably the best way to study a language on your own. So to all you who may have been put off by the fact that it is an exam preparation book please do yourselves a favor and buy this book.
Summary 4: Wow!! No one should walk into the AP Spanish Language Exam without having studying and prepped with these practices.
Summary 5: The book did not come with the audio CDs so I contacted Mr. Peters and he very kindly refunded my money. He is a very trustworthy seller."
0802847390,Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists,"Summary 1: .Size matters. Many Christians know of J.B. Phillips classic book, Your God is Too Small. But few consider the possibility that their God is too BIG. When believers zealously attach all the ""omnis"" they can imagine to God, perhaps who emerges is not the God of scripture at all. What seems required is a God neither too small nor too big.Constructing an adequate vision of God is the principal goal for essayists in Searching for an Adequate God. Of course, as contributor William Hasker remarks, ""it is our conceptions of God that must be evaluated as adequate or inadequate, not God himself."" Most essayists contend that a concept of God adequate to scripture, tradition, reason, and experience (the Wesleyan quadrilateral) is required or, as Hasker puts it, a conception of God ""adequate for the faith and life of the Christian church."" Whether explicitly or implicitly stated, both sides consider their own theistic conceptions to be more adequate given these criteria.Given classical free-will theism's ties to evangelicalism and process theism's ties to liberal Christianity, it may seem unlikely to outsiders that the visions entertained by these camps overlap to any degree. However, even insiders may be surprised to find the large extent to which these visions can be harmonized. In many ways, Searching for an Adequate God serves as a bridge-builder. It reveals to the evangelical community that the process vision is more palatable than many had previously thought. The book also reveals to process theists, who typically run in liberal theological circles, that free-will/openness versions of evangelical theology are more palatable than they had assumed.Tenets pertaining to divine love sit atop the list of convictions shared by these process and classical free-will/openness theists. Both sides affirm that God is love; God lovingly interacts with the world; God is genuinely affected by give-and-take love with the world; and God's primary, if not exclusive, modus operandi is persuasive love. Free-will/openness theist Richard Rice comments, ""Process thought is often described as a metaphysics of love, an attempt to develop a full-fledged metaphysical system from the fundamental insight that God is love. The open view of God [a.k.a. free-will theism] shares this emphasis upon the priority of love.""Consistent with this emphasis upon divine love and love's implications are the emphases by both traditions upon relationality, freedom (e.g., both reject compatiblism and determinism), and the social nature of the God-world relationship. Additionally, both reject the argument that God can have certain knowledge of the entire future. Given these emphases, it is understandable that both theological perspectives sharply criticize notions -- which theists derived from classical metaphysics -- portraying God as aloof, impervious, or all-determining.Both process and classical free-will theists affirm that God is providentially active in both human and nonhuman life. Both process and classical free-will theists hold that God is personal, purposive, and pantemporal.It may surprise some to find that the issue of biblical authority does not arise as a major obstacle in this free-will/openness and process dialogue. In this volume, the process theists never chide free-will/openness theists for the latter's insistence upon the primary authority of the Bible. Free-will/openness theists only occasionally scold process theists for failing to appreciate the biblical witness. In fact, both sides appeal to an interpretation of scripture they believe supports their own theological vision.The leg of the quadrilateral stool on which these theisms seem to differ most is Christian tradition. For instance, essayist David Griffin considers the tradition's doctrine of creatio ex nihilo indirectly damaging to the claim that God is love. A God able unilaterally to create the world is culpable for failing unilaterally to prevent genuine evil. He proposes, instead, a doctrine of creation grounded upon divine persuasion, theistic evolution, and a God-initiated Big Bang cosmology. Free-will/openness theists, however, accept creatio ex nihilo. For free-will/openness theists, the traditional creation doctrine supports a strong eschatology and explains God's miracle-generating activity.At the heart of their theological differences are the theories of divine power, although each can agree on a formal definition of divine power (e.g., God's power is supreme, and deity possesses all the power it is possible for any being to have). On one hand, free-will/openness theists contend that God possessed, at least at one time, absolutely all power. Furthermore, these theists contend that God can unilaterally determine some events or situations -- should God choose to do so. Free-will/openness essayist Hasker believes that a God who can both unilaterally determine (coerce) and act cooperatively (persuade) is greater, and therefore more adequate, than the God who only acts persuasively. Process theist Griffin, on the other hand, avers that God never possesses a monopoly on power, which means that God never entirely determines an outcome. Griffin contends that the problem of evil, among other problems, remains insoluble for theists who believe God that is able to determine unilaterally.Many of the essayists share fascinating autobiographical material. Nancy Howell, Wheeler, and Rice disclose how, in their own journeys, they embraced or rejected various aspects of process and evangelical traditions. For Wheeler, to cite one, the evangelical faith of his youth and the process theism he discovered in graduate school are not mutually exclusive. To varying degrees, these scholars live inside, outside, and/or between theological traditions. To use Howell's image, these authors maneuver among theological boundaries.Conceiving of a ""right-sized"" God truly matters. The risks and fears that Pinnock describes indicate just how politically-charged the task of formulating theology can be. This book provides a valuable resource for adventurers undertaking this all-important quest.Thomas Jay Oord
Summary 2: I got this book, because I wanted to gain a greater understanding of Process Theism. I was familiar with free will theism, but certain aspects of it were troubling to me. While I find myself disagreeing with some of what process theologians have to say, it has been extremely helpful for me in clarifying my own viewpoint. I enjoyed the debate format that gave others a chance to respond and point out weak points and strong points in each of the articles.
Summary 3: ""Searching for an adequate god"" is an anthology promoting a dialogue between Free Will Theists and Process Theists. One of the editors is Clark H. Pinnock, apparently something of a red cloth to the evangelical bull. (Just read some of the other reviews.) Most of the articles are frankly uninteresting. I never understood the difference between Free Will Theists and regular Christianity (minus the hard line believers in predestination). Perhaps the Christianity I'm familiar with *is* Free Will Theism? Didn't Abraham argue with God about the destruction of Sodom, didn't Jesus change tack when the Jews rejected him, etc?The main attractions are the two articles by David Ray Griffin. He seems to be one of the leading process theologians. Griffin very self-consciously wants to adapt Christianity to modern science and philosophy, in other words, evangelize people like myself. I can't say I was impressed. He ends up having the worst of both worlds. Unless I've misread him on some crucial point, Griffin believes that Jesus was an ordinary human with psychokinetic powers who wasn't really resurrected. Rather, he lived on as a spiritual ""personality"". So will everyone else. Already here, Griffin will loose most scientists, who will find it hard to believe in parapsychology or an immortal soul. Also, the admittedly fascinating metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead probably don't square very well with the vaguely positivistic metaphysics I take it are most common among secularized scientists. On the more religious side, Griffin attempts to solve the problem of evil by denying God's omnipotence. Griffin's God is all-good but powerless. In fact, he is less powerful than humans! At the very least, that's the logical consequence of the process view.Why would a modern like myself want to convert to a creed that's just as unscientific as regular Christianity, while having no answer to the existential problem of evil and suffering?At one point, Griffin indignantly wonders what a Free Will Theist (or classical theist, for that matter) might want to say to a mother whose children are being burnt to death in a concentration camp. Presumably, the Free Will Theists must say that God could stop the murders, but has chosen not to, for some unfathomable reason. (The predestinarian response would, of course, be even worse.) But what is *Griffin's* response? That God *cannot* stop genocide at all, even in principle? In what sense is that different from the atheist answer? Griffin believes in life after death, but some process theologians apparently don't even do that! Small wonder Griffin calls for a world government (sic) in his article. Without the inadequate god of Process Theism, only a superior military force can stop genocide...You may interpret this review in any way you see fit. But yes, I like Pinnock's ""inclusivism"". ;-)
Summary 4: This book proves Mr. Pinnock, rather than dialoguing with Conservative, Evangelical Providence-Theists, is himself an extreme libertarian ultra-arminian attempting a synthesis & amalgamation with Processism in reaction to his perceived brand of hyper-calvinism (which few embrace and none of the authors who devastate free-willism like Millard Erickson).This is Quasi-Processism plain and simple.CHAFF OUTWEIGHS THE WHEATMORE STEAK SAUCE THAN MEAT
Summary 5: While attempting to build a case for Open Theory of Bible Interpretation,which selectively/artificially literalizes much of Bible's God-analogous-to-man language (conveniently excluding physical form texts or Divine Unknown Question texts like ""Saul,Saul,why do you persecute Me?"" ""Cain, why is your face downcast?"" ""Moses, why do you cry out to Me?"" and dozens more)all the author has demonstrated is the debt Openness owes to Charles Hartshorne,Bi-Polar Processist (see separate review of Hartshorne's 'Omnipotence&Other; Theological Mistakes',so seminal/paradigmatic for Open Theory).He tries to distance Open deity from Process deity, and many points are valid [God is not identified with the world pantheistically or unable to use His power from time-to-time to intervene and make adjustments to the course of history, or of necessity dependent on Creation(merely by free loving choice),Trinity,Creation Ex Nihilo,etc.]Openness is not equivalent to Process, but the commonalities and co-presuppositions are striking and ramifications on how they do theology are often unwitting, yet like Greg Boyd,he acknowledges philosophical/metaphysical/rational/paradigmatic indebtedness to Hartshorne,without whom Open Theory would most likely not have come to be.Some excerpts from Pinnock's recent Evangelical Society essay highlight how far he has trespassed over the borderline separating Orthodox Christianity from Process and Free-Will theories:SELF-EMPTYING DIVINE ATTRIBUTES -We could think of Open view as a theology of kenosis,i.e. 'Self-Emptying'.God freely chose self-limitation for the sake of covenant with humankind,just as the Son of God,surrendering the divine glory to become human,chose to enter fully into the human condition and share in human suffering. It is characteristic of love to be Self-Emptying and the Incarnation reveals how God likes to use His power,not to dominate,but to love. In creating,there was Self-Emptying of Omnipotence (see Hartshorne's book above). There is also Self-Emptying of Eternity. By bringing into being a Temporal creation whose nature is expressed sequentially as unfolding history,the Creator granted reality to Time and ACTUALIZED IN HIS DIVINE NATURE A TEMPORAL POLE such that He knows things as they really are temporally in succession. There must be in God BOTH THAT WHICH IS WHOLLY FREE FROM VARIATION BUT ALSO THAT WHICH CORRESPONDS TO VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES OF A TEMPORAL universe. INCARNATION INVOLVES SO DRASTIC AN INVOLVEMENT WITH TEMPORAL reality we conclude Time is not foreign to Divine Self-Emptying Nature.This is enough of an idea from Pinnock's recent public teaching to conclude:1)It is unashamedly BI-POLAR as a theology,jettisoning the Biblical concept of MONO-POLAR Theism. Pinnock even used the processistic buzzwords of'actualized in his divine nature a Temporal Pole', and God is 'both free from variation and varies with varying circumstances',i.e.poles of changing and non-changing. The free-will deity is Bi-Polar in regards to divine attributes,thus double/dual/binary poles/terminals/loci/foci/cores of reality/nature/being/existence/relationality - straight from the Process Playbook as this book abundantly shows him in dialog with Process Theists.2)It's fine to emphasize the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity,since that's the core of Scripture/Christianity.However,to violate Paul's dictum of ""Do not go beyond what is written!"" is to transgress Evangelical Boundaries into illegitimate territory:neo-Processistic Bi-Polarism. For Pinnock to conclude that since Christ became incarnate (remember this was a miraculous 33-year manifestation of Son of God on earth in human flesh to accomplish the sin bearing mission) means a continual/permanent norm of Trinitarian Revelation or change in God the Father and God the Holy Spirit or 'Self-Emptying of the Trinity to accomodate to mortal/temporal reality' is heterodoxy of the First Order.As the Bible actually teaches, the Son of God added a human nature to His Divine Nature without compromising/reducing/evacuating His Deity -FOR A SEASON ONLY (Pre-Glorification).To assert that the Father and the Holy Spirit also are Incarnatized,Finitized,Self-Emptying,Temporally Limited,Bi-Polar is to encroach WAY BEYOND what is written! Scripture knows of no such aberrant/overboard novel heterodoxy.3)If according to Pinnock God's Divine Attributes are all Self-Emptying (Omnipotence,Eternity, Omnipresence,Changelessness,etc.)then too must Omniscience be Self-Emptying/Temporalized/Limited/Finite. That's why he arrives at God not having any DEFINITE EXHAUSTIVE awareness of self-determining free-agent futures since they don't exist in God's 'present reality' to be known.The Future is NOT REAL!In summary, Pinnock here and elsewhere with his conditional solidarity with Processistic thought as evidenced by his dialogue with Process/Bi-Polar theorists to shape his theology ends up to no surprise with a deity quite different from the Bible as held by Jews/Rabbis,Church Fathers,Prot.Reformers,Roman Catholic,Eastern Orthodox,Evangelical Historical interpretation of Scripture.The Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity for a specific,33-year miracle of Redemptive Revelation now becomes normative for the First and Third Persons of God as well who also share in the Incarnatization on an ongoing basis to properly,lovingly relate to us,distorting clear Bible teaching and making a mockery of the true doctrine/purpose of Christmas (it wasn't after all 'Patrimas'-Father's sending; or'Pneumas' -Spirit's sending; or 'Trinimas' -Trinity's sending,but CHRIST-mas:Christ's,Jesus',Son of God's mission.There is profound Mystery in the Incarnation and Triune Godhead, but to twist and tweak Cardinal Biblical Truth into Mystical/Mythical speculation/conjecture about the Father and Spirit being also in a sense Incarnatized similar to Christ,and even the Risen,Ascended,Glorified,Enthroned,Yet-to-Come Son of God being 'Self-Emptying'beyond His Resurrection/Glorification/Exaltation is Aberrant Heterodoxy of the First Magnitude on Cardinal Doctrinal levels.(See separate review of Pinnock's more recent 'Most Moved Mover' detailing its almost LDS/Mormon conception of an embodied/not-necessarily-pure-spirit-being-sort of deity and an errant Bible as well as amisprophesying Christ and other contra-biblical speculation).This is what John MacArthur in 'Bound Only Once' has to conclude about Pinnock's brand of 'Self-Emptying Theism'-In C.S.Lewis' Narnia Chronicles,Aslan,the fierce but loving lion,represents Christ the 'wild,not tame lion,both good and fearsome.People who have not been to Narnia sometimes think a thing can't be good and terrible at the same time.'That same basic false assumption was the starting point for the heresy of Open Theism. New-model theologians assume God could not be good and terrible at the same time,so they set out to divest Him of whatever attributes they didn't like ('empty' him of them)and pad the ones they like (Love,Relational,Vulnerable,Intimate,Risk,Learn,Share,etc.)Like Socinians and liberals(processists)before them,they are on the misguided quest to make God 'good' according to humanistic/rationalistic definition of what they consider 'good',devising a deity of their own making (see Norm Geisler's book BATTLE FOR GOD refuting Open Theism).In the final book of Narnia,a wicked ape drapes a lion skin over a witless donkey and pretends it to be Aslan,a sinister,dangerous pretense leading countless Narnians astray. The Open deity is like the donkey in an ill-fitting lion's skin,leading many sincere seekers away from the glorious Son of God of Scripture.Aslan(Christ) is both good and fearsome,loving and wrathful,benevolent and terrifying,deliverer and destroyer,rewarder and punisher,blesser and curser. His wrath is just as real as His love,His fangs are just as real as His fur,His claws are every bit as real as His cuddliness.If only Pinnock would have read more C.S.Lewis and Scripture and less of Hartshorne,Cobb,Whitehead and non-evangelical,liberal theorists,books like SEARCHING FOR AN ADEQUATE GOD would never have been written or need to be exposed as an artificial lion skin covering revisionist fantasy.
Summary 6: This book joins a growing number using peculiar adjectives to portray God: 'Adequate','Open','Possible','Vulnerable','In Process','Progressing',etc. It's enough to make one wonder what the True God in Heaven has to say about the matter of His Glorious Person! The one strength of this book - exposing many of process thought's incoherences and unbiblical concepts (which can't help but make 'free-will theism' more palatable by comparison!) - is overshadowed by multiple deficiences of exegesis, theology, philosophy, logic, Control Beliefs(epistemology), Biblical adherence. The main problem seems to be an almost 'theistic evolution' concept: but the novelty is that instead of applying to creation, it here applies to no less than the Creator Himself! He too is evolving, progressing, in transition (changing as it becomes virtuous to do so), growing to be all He can be along with His evolving,in process creatures. This innovative conclusion arises from authors'Control Beliefs. These constitute interpretive grids, faith filters,believability indices, possibility parameters, internal discriminators, thought templates that are instinctively, involuntarily activated in the mind which generate values, paradigms, a priori presuppositions that adjudicate and arbitrate data gathering, processing, assimilation. They act as 'contact lenses' through which life is viewed and interpreted. Of course while wearing them, we don't see them; it's much easier to see what we perceive others are wearing. These non-objective (or partially at best) lenses inform us as to what is tenable or untenable; welcome or unwelcome; acceptable or not; tolerable, intolerable; logical/Biblical or not; friend or foe; true(as perceived) or untrue. With theological interpretation and formulation, Control Beliefs - our lenses - not only shape/shade what theories and beliefs we want to hold, but what evidence we will even be 'open' to in the first place; how much weight we attach to data; how we define terms and formulate conclusions; how we compare/contrast and analyze what is perceived to be Biblical,factual, logical, valid. (The old saying: 'We are entitled to our opinions, but no one has the right to be wrong with the facts.') All too often our Control Beliefs orbit around a few selective concepts integrated into our thinking patterns/grid from experiences, education,intellectual exposures, personality, influences (Holy Spirit, evil spirits, self-deceptive inner spirit).The authors' Control Beliefs are not documented,discussed, evaluated,compared for plausibility or correspondence with Biblical facts. It is tacitly assumed that their lenses are clear,20/20,unwarped, unfogged,uncolored,objective,correct universal prescription vis a vis opponents' lenses. Until this is addressed, no genuine dialogue seems possible with historically evangelical positions, since all the 'proof texting' or citation of witnesses or evidence will be automatically skewed or distorted by the sincere,but sincerely wrong undisclosed and unrecognized Control Beliefs, lenses 'seen through without being seen'. Neither 'process' nor 'openness' Control Beliefs align with the inspired divinely corrected lenses of the Biblical authors when all Scriptural data are considered in a balanced,plenary way. As long as process or openness Control Beliefs continue to control Biblical Control Beliefs (inaccurately and selectively drawn or eisegeted from 'friendly' texts), philosophy - whether Aristotle or Whitehead or Hartshorne or Hasker,et al; logic and extra-biblical lensing will retain a controlling and magisterial role viz.Scripture's controlled, ministerial role. 'Adequate' in, Inadequate out."
0714843067,Maurizio Cattelan (Contemporary Artists),"Summary 1: Beware that this is a mini book, which makes looking at Cattelan's artwork almost impossible. Cattelan is an incredibly funny, satiric, conceptual sculptor. His work makes fun of the gallery system in an intelligent way but also moves beyond the criticism of art politics. Some of his work has recently earned the presitgious title of ""controversial"" (the images of himself hanging from a tree). I put Cattelan in the same category as Manzoni, Fontana...great book but I would order the bigger one.
Summary 2: This book is a must have for any fan of Maurizio Cattelan. When Phiadon Press asked the artists if they could publish a book on him in a series of books on contemporary artists, he insisted the book be one quarter size of all the others in the series. If you think that is interesting, wait until you see the rest of the images, and read the interviews, WOW. This guy is amazingly intelligent and defined in his methods and concepts.The book unfortunately is just not enough info on the artist, but there is not one printed book yet that does have all the info, but this is a great book for anyone who is interested in learnig about this fantastic contemporary artist.
Summary 3: Got into cattelan via Vogue magazine article about his panksterism which reminded me of the movie Fight Club. If you love Fight Club, then you will appreciate Cattelan's work & how he comes about ideas."
0316899763,The Art of Planting,"Summary 1: Rosemary Verey is the doyenne of English gardeners and as such can teach any gardener something. Although American gardeners must proceed cautiously when trying to replicate English garden ideas--owing to differing moisture conditions, the chalk base under British beds, and latitude/longitude considerations, i.e. the effects of the sun--THE ART OF PLANTING contains much to recommend it.For example, Verey shows us Mrs Pugh's bog garden at Docton Mill in Devon. Devon has a climate comparable to Zones 7 &amp; 8 in the U.S. but the sun does not get nearly as hot in the summer months in Devon as it does in most Zone 7 &amp; 8 U.S. areas. Devon is further north and it is warmed by the Gulf Stream like New England.Mrs. Pugh grows Iris, ferns and Hosta lillies in her garden. Her ferns include the osrich plume fern 'Osmunda Regalis' which grows wild in the eastern U.S.--I have found them in drainage ditches but you can buy them at a good nursery. Mrs. Pugh also grows Iris pallida. I have been able to grow a similar plant in Virginia--Iris siberica which requires both dampness and sun. Most Hosta lillies would not last in the same garden as the Iris or the fern, however. Hostas mostly prefer shade like the ferns, but they also like dry conditions. In fact, they are a mainstay in my shade gardens. If you try to replicate Mrs. Pugh's garden, you may have to improvise with plants that like both the U.S. sun and dampness.In addition to the wide array of growing conditions, Verey discusses the use of color, shape and texture in planting. She says, &quot;Some plants need shining leaves to set them off, particularly...white flowers with green centers. Other, like potentillas merge with their foliage.&quot; In other words, consider not only the juxtapostion of flower color and size but the neighborliness of leaves. In one photo shows the iceberg rose 'Schneewitchen' growing in a bed of 'Stachys' or lamb's ears. The glossy green leaves of the rose contrast nicely with the soft green fuzzy leaves of the Stachys and the large white flowers of the rose blend beautifully with the contrasting green leaves.There are several sets of photos and text discussing the use of monochromatic color schemes. The most famous example of the white scheme is the White Garden at Sissinghurst, but Verey shows the reader Anne Dexter's tiny Oxford garden where a white hydrangea stands next to a hidden door. Another monochromatic scheme might be purple, using Campanula persicifolia and Stachys byzantina, and blue pansies and hyacinths.The U.S. gardener might not be able to copy the designs Verey shows exactly because blooming times for plants vary from place to place. Verey's color schemes could be executed with local plants, however. The easiest way to discover what might work is to take a trip to the local nursery and pick out plants blooming close to the same time. Ask the nursery staff if the plants came from a hothouse, because sometimes plants bloom out of season owing to sheltered conditions. This is less of a problem during the warmer months. Our local nursery divides the shade loving plants from the sunny border plants which is a big help.This wouldn't be an English gardening book without a discussion of borders, and Verey doesn't fail to supply the requisite text and photos. Again, some of the ideas cannot be executed in the U.S. in the exact detail shown, but there are many possible exceptions. For example, she shows Perovskia growing behind Viola cornuta which will work in some areas in zone 6 and 7. Hoever, the Viola may burn up under some condtions.I recommend this book to anyone who loves beautiful garden photographs, and/or is searching for garden design ideas. Although you may not be able to replicate the gardens shown in every detail, you will find Verey's suggestions useful if you live in growing zones 6-8.
Summary 2: Crisp, clear photography. A masterful guide to companion plants --you'll want to recreate them in your own garden. Drawing from her years of experience and knowledge of gardens of the world Rosemary Verrey shows you in narrative photographs how to create color palletes that are soothing to the senses. Even those photographs of brightly colored combinations avoid the glaring and garish look of some boldly colored gardens. Multiple photographs of similar plant combinations make it easy to create the look that you want and still exercise your own creativity. Includes beds of mixed borders, bulbs, woodland, ground covers, and damp/ boggy sites.Worth buying for the photography alone.
Summary 3: This book by the late Rosemary Verey is stunning and most inspirational. The plantings and pictures are gorgeous. The concepts of color contrast and harmony--painting with color-- are worked into the text and captions, with the detailed botanical and cultivar names fully cited. The only great problem is that these are English gardens, adapted to a moist and cloudy regime that rarely exists in America with its climate extremes and strong seasonality--as ex-patriate Thalassa Cruso (Making Things Grow) discovered years ago. You won't get the green lawns and misty colors shown everywhere here, and you'll need another source book to check for USDA hardiness zone or cultivation information. While Verey has visited North American gardens she has little to say about them. Nevertheless, Verey's concepts of seasonal associations of disparate yet harmonized plants are spot on. The picture captions are highly informative alone, and the extensive text is like a personal journey, including which English garden first inspired which idea. (She published other books that contain the garden plans, especially for her own estate at Barnsley Hall.) I found her ideas to have late climbing plants emerge through early blooming shrubs most interesting. This is a lovely, large, and inspiring book of color photographs and concepts."
0880104406,The Spiritual Hierarchies and the Physical World: Reality and Illusion,"Summary 1: Intriguing book. In it are each of the hierarchies recorded:- when they became active,- which planets were formed by which hierarchie- how hierarchies are related to each other (only mentioned notexplained in detail with the highest hierarchies).In the book are also mentioned:- The zodiac and how they are related to the hierarchies; andwhat it means when a certain sign is active.- Some about what parts of the physical body of a human werealready formed in spirit world by the different hierarchies...Cancer as symbol for the ribcage which was formed for example.- The seven oracles in Atlantean time (Sun oracle, Venus oracleetc.) and that the one who had the most developed ether body ofthe oracles (the leaders) were selected to work through the 7rishi's in India in a later time.- The lowest hierarchies (Angels, ArchAngels and Archia) areexplained in great detail: (a) how they relate to the mineral,plant and animal kingdom and that their physical body, ether body, astral body and the I are located in different spheres (Angel only physical body in the Earth, ArchAngel physical body and ether body in the Earh, Archia physical, ether and astral body in the Earth while Humans have all four parts in the Earth (in this time!!!).Also mentioned is difference between Copernicus' astrological system (viewed from physical viewpoint) and the Ptolemeus astrology (viewed from spiritual perspective - i.e. the spiritual hierarchie view).I found the book to be really intruiging, but it lacked (for me) how the different entities are active now in the Earth, and how can be seen which people have interacted more with certain entities than others... In the book is recorded that Venus entities were present in the Earth to bring greater wisdom at one time, and Mars entities brought about other influences but not beyond: how do they play a role now, when and how did they made their presence felt over time (as the Earth developed) etc.So: very intruiging book, explanations about several things, but only when they first appeared. Only briefly mentioned activity later on in the 7 rishi's, Jesus, but not on when/how the different entities made their presence felt in the Earth in more recent times (or other times) with the exception of Angels, Archangels and Archia. Especially Angels are explained at length.But what about other entities... only briefly discussing them makes it harder to see the overall picture: all the times when, and how, the entities made their presence felt.Besides that it is an intruiging book to read.PS I read the Ducth version!!!
Summary 2: Steiner's world view is a rich and astonishing Rosicrucian cosmogony, and must be confronted by any serious spiritual researcher of Western esotericism and Christianity. Like many of his works, this work is provocative, and one is left both bewildered and entranced, and wondering what to DO, how to work with the vision contained herein. Some of Steiner's other works, specifically OUTLINE OF ESOTERIC SCIENCE, and HOW TO KNOW HIGHER WORLDS would be a better place to begin exploring Steiner. But this was my first exposure to Rudolf Steiner, and it grabbed me and I couldn't shake it off! Today I still struggle and ponder these ideas, and maybe that is quite the point.
Summary 3: This book explains in great detail and easy to understand the great higher hierarchies that formed this universe with special attention to this earth. This book explains Masonic mysteries regarding these hierarchies and their role in the evolution of man and earth. It explains the history of the solar system and humans. It includes the ""War in Heaven"" with more explanation than is in the books of religion that have been available to us in the past. It explains the evolution of our solar system including changes it has and will go through. How higher hierarchies lead humanity. There is a higher understanding of Cain and Able explained. The book explains how the great Hierarchies got to be what they are and what they do."
B000MV8HDY,The New Yellow Bulldozer,"Summary 1: A wonderful book for tiny hands and eyes, moveable parts and simple words, bright, clear illustrations, a must for car and engine obsessed little ones.
Summary 2: This book is brilliant! My little boy adores this. So many pop-ups, moving bits and a cracker of a story. It gets a work-out pretty regularly.
Summary 3: Great kid interactive book. Lots of different action pop-ups. A really fun book for kids."
0891457070,Westmoreland Glass: Identification and Value Guide,"Summary 1: This is an excellent book that details the history of Westmoreland Glass as no other book has provided before this one. Wilson makes the strong and persuasive argument that Westmoreland was THE leader of decorated glass production in the 1920s and 1930s in the United States, was the first company to produce carnvial glass, and was the leader in the design and production of candy containers. This book details the family history of the author's grandfather, Chas West, and great uncle, George West, in the founding of Westmoreland in the late 1880s till the changing of the guard in the late 1930s to the Brainard family. It is well organized in content and photographs. However, if you are looking for a milk glass book or a book on paneled grape, then do not buy this book. If you are looking for a book that will surprise you about Westmoreland to the point that you did not understand the depth of Westmoreland's contribution to Americana and the U.S. glass making history, then you will be purchasing the correct book.
Summary 2: This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points, but extremely weak on others. It provides the most detailed history of Westmoreland Glass that I have ever seen, and some of the facts are fascinating. However, it is very, very, very poorly organized. Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should. I would NOT recommend Kovar's books on any subject.
Summary 3: I've been searching for a Westmoreland reference book for some time now that gave good history on the glass company as well as included information on the very early patterns that Westmoreland made. Most other related reference books on the subject concentrates on later production patterns of which I have no interest in collecting. A good read, if you are interested in reading glass co. and its owner's history. Photos are good, I was very happy with the purchase.
Summary 4: This book was informative about the history of Westmoreland glass. The only thing I wish it had was more information on value
Summary 5: Great service from these folks. The book was in excellent condition and arrived in fine time!"
B000HMOE62,Three Who Made a Revolution A Biographical History,"Summary 1: I've lamented in other reviews about good books that have gone out of print. Therefore what a pleasure it is to find that Betram D. Wolfe's &quot;Three Who Made a Revolution&quot; is back on the shelves. I read it first when I was in school -- one of the first serious or challenging &quot;adult&quot; books that I read with pleasure. I'm a little chagrined to recall some of my own responses. On the one hand, I remember entertaining the uneasy sense that the book was probably too much fun to be &quot;real scholarship.&quot; Maybe a little -- but in retrospect, I think most of the fun comes not from mere clowning, but from Wolfe's real engagement with the humanity of his subjects. On the other hand, I remember writing in a term paper something along the lines of how the book would probably put a damper on further research. I think I knew as I wrote it that this was a pretty fatuous remark, but hey, I was on a deadline. Anyway, it is nice to be able to recognize in retrospect that (a) it of course certainly did nothing at all to dampen further reserach; but (b) despite the torrent of further research, it still repays rereading.Wolfe wrote at a time when the left was still pretty gullible about Communism. There was, of course, an anti-communist opposition: in the long run the antis have proved to be more right than the apologists, but it is not so clear how much this is the result of careful research, how much of lucky accident. At any rate, giving a few points for hindsight, Wolfe's moral clarity is in retrospect pretty clear. And whatever his imperfections, he probably motivated me to read a lot of stuff I might otherwise never have come to: I remember particularly Trotsky's own autobiography, Adam Ulam's &quot;Unfinished Revolution,&quot;, and Robert V. Daniels' &quot;Documentary History of Communism,&quot; all of which I read in the weeks after I had finished Wolfe, and while I was still operating in his wake -- to say nothing of whatever I have picked up in the generation or more since. Any book that can stimulate that kind of inquiry has justified itself, no matter what its intrinsic merits -- and in this case, the intrinsic merits are pretty strong, also.
Summary 2: A study of the events leading to the Russian revolution through a biography of its three main leaders: Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky. Bertram Wolfe wrote this book in 1948. He didn't have the access to official documents that today historians of the Russian revolution have. But as one of the founders of the US Communist party, he knew some of the Soviet leaders himself (including Stalin) and he did a thorough job looking at the Soviet press, the Soviet propaganda, the autobiographies of the exiled leaders (Trotsky and the Georgian Mensheviks were particularly useful in this regard). Through this ""archaeological"" work (his own term), seeing how different accounts confirmed or contradicted each other, he was able to find a lot about the beginnings of the Russian revolution. Only in writing about the early life of Stalin he made some mistakes, since the Soviet leader himself try to disguise a lot of his early life through the official hagiographies (Wolfe, for example, states that he was born in 1879, not 1878, that his father died in 1890 and not some two decades later, and he downplays his early role as a revolutionary in the Caucasus, following Trotsky). Wolfe's viewpoint is very interesting, and original at the time it was written, that of a disillusioned believer. Many of the things he charged the Soviets were learned some years later to be true, following Khrushchev's secret speech. Overall, a very good work that has stood the test of time.
Summary 3: This hefty volume, long considered a standard work, follows the minutiae of international socialist squabbling over decades, but comes to an abrupt end with the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The Revolution itself never appears, let alone the first decade or so of Bolshevik rule or the attempted socialist uprisings in neighboring countries. Where's the rest of the story?"
0275979644,The Naked Clone: How Cloning Bans Threaten Our Personal Rights,"Summary 1: Absolute genius! Professor Kunich takes a look at all the nonsense swirling around human cloning, and rips the mask off of it. With brilliant clarity and insight, this book exposes the many fallacies riddling the anti-cloning movement. Most important of all, Kunich's book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that if the government bans cloning, some of our most precious civil liberties may be next. This is a book for the ages, but especially our age.
Summary 2: The subject matter is human freedom, and this book is one which raises fundamental issues about the freedoms of man in relation to cloning. If freedom and cloning are subjects of concern, a more appropriate read cannot be found. The book is fascinating, bold and powerful, one of the most important books about the cloning controversy. You may agree or disagree with the author on his conclusions but you'll never be bored for a minute.We have freedoms now that scarcely existed five hundred years ago or even one hundred years ago. A century from now new freedoms or aspects of freedoms will exist. These new freedoms, like the old ones, will have to be won through the efforts of people like John C. Kunich.William C. O'Rights
Summary 3: I have known John personally for many years. I remember our discussion on my back patio about cloning and the issues it brought to the forefront of society as a whole. Wow, did he open my eyes. His insights are genius. Get this book and enjoy your next dinner party with your own new found ideas this book will generate for you."
B000IOF10C,Traps: A Novel of the FBI,"Summary 1: As the title implies, traps of various kinds pepper the plot, including ""bank traps,"" which underachieving FBI agent Jack Kincade uses to rip off bank night deposit drops. The money doesn't go towards supporting an affluent lifestyle; this down-and-out divorcee is living in a dive motel, drinking cheap vodka, and driving a battered minivan. But poker money has to come from somewhere.Jack, who's found all the ways to dodge work a bureaucracy can offer, must investigate a massive bomb threat. A desperate man planted the bomb hoping to force the FBI to finally solve his daughter's murder. Jack partners with Ben Alton to follow some leads.The two couldn't be more different. Ben, a family man, is a go-getter who worked his way up from the projects. He sets his mind to something and doesn't give up. But he's not working at 100% because he recently lost the lower half of his leg to cancer, and though he's back a month early to help with the investigation, the boss assigns him to desk duty for his own safety.Of all the available agents, these two seem the least likely to succeed, but Jack's sharp powers of deduction and Ben's unstoppable energy work together well, and with some luck, the old crime is solved. But questions still remain, and the pair dig deeper to find another more-horrifying layer of murderous revenge. They must stay one step ahead of the villain and his traps; Jack's got to stay ahead of the FBI's internal police.This audiobook had me hooked from start to finish. The pace never slows, nor does it move too fast that you can't understand what's happening. I'm no expert on the FBI, but the author certainly made me feel I was inside the organization, with its politics and personalities. Some events stretched the limits of disbelief, but I don't think they went too far.As for the performance by the reader, it was mostly OK, but I have a few compaints. The voice of Jack was very gruff. At first I didn't think I'd want to sit through a whole book with that voice. I got used to it, but I never really liked it. He also mispronounced ""interment"" as ""internment."" My biggest gripe however is how his voice dropped off at the end of sentences. Since I listen while driving, hearing those words was quite a problem.And sure, the ""odd couple"" pairing of Ben and Jack has been done to death, but this author pulled it off. They fire off some funny lines and it never became tiresome. The writing style is clear, never overwrought. This book isn't the same old thing. It's actually darn good.
Summary 2: It has been three years since his daughter has been kidnapped and the FBI still has not the slightest idea what happened to Leah Ziven. Her father Conrad builds a bomb and plants it under the Cook County jail, which houses over 15,000 prisoners. Only he has the combination to disarm the bomb and he won't give it out until they find his daughter.FBI agent Jack Kincade, a man who robs banks as a sideline is partnered with Ben Alton, an amputee victim with something to prove. The hastily formed team finds the girl's body and the ransom at an abandoned shack. Leah's father gives them the data they need to remove the bomb but that doesn't end the case because the killer is still out there. Ben and Jack (not Jerry, silly) are on his case, trying to break him, a very dangerous thing to do to a psychopath with nothing left to lose.TRAPS is a fascinating crime thriller due to the enigmatic anti-hero Jack Kincade. He's a drunk and a gambler who cut off all communication with his son. He robs banks to support his gambling habit yet in spite of all these failing, readers feel drawn to this bad boy because they sense there is a kernel of decency and goodness buried in his heart, waiting to bloom under the right conditions. Paul Lindsay will appeal to readers who like the novels of Patricia Cornwell and Robert W. Walker.Harriet Klausner
Summary 3: This is definitely one of Mr Lindsay's best FBI novels to date. Jack Kincaid, our tragic hero, is someone I felt sorry for, yet admired at the same time, flaws and all. Loved his detecting skills. The story was riveting and came to a thrilling climax. I'd pretty much figured out the ending, so was kind of reluctant to finish because I didn't want to be right. Overall, a very enjoyable FBI procedural, with a likable tragic hero. Looking forward to what comes next from Mr Lindsay.
Summary 4: As readers of Paul Lindsay novels know, the former FBI agent often portrays the modern day FBI in a less than flattering manner. What John Grisham did for layers in his novels, Paul Lindsey has done for the FBI. However, usually Paul Lindsey novels have at their core an agent hero fighting a flawed system where stats and appearances weigh more heavily than actual police work. In this thoroughly depressing novel, which also lacks any shred of humor found in his other works, the hero is fatally flawed on so many levels; the conclusion becomes anti-climatic and expected.Jack Kincade is an alcoholic, a degenerate gambler according to his ex-wife's attorney, a non-existent father to his son, Cole, and a burned out FBI agent. Emotionally dead to himself and others, he spices up his life by robbing banks using a technique perfected years ago involving night deposits. Assigned to investigate those same cases, which are very low dollar in terms of risk and reward, he has managed to dead end them all to this point. However, a lie can only be sustained so long.Thanks to the unexpected re-opening of a three-year-old kidnapping case after the frustrated father plants a bomb under the local jail, Jack Kincade's world slowly begins to its final collapse. Partnered with Agent Ben Alton who is currently in remission form cancer after doctors amputated part of one leg, they begin to work the case. But in so doing, while successful on one level, Alton makes a fatal error in judgment with massive repercussions for everyone. With all the speed and emotion of geologic plates, this novel grinds toward a steadily darker life for all the characters involved in this novel.This certainly is not the best that Paul Lindsey has to offer. Virtually all the characters involved in this 260-page novel, are robotic in thought, emotion, and deed. That fact coupled with the incredible amount of loathing and self hatred expressed by many of these characters is appalling. The redeeming motivations found in his works are sadly lacking in this effort. Hopefully, this book is not a sign that like his fictional characters; Paul Lindsey is burned out as an author."
0812014189,"Great Danes: Everything About Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Breeding, Behavior, and Training With 46 Color Photos (Complete Pet Owners Manual)","Summary 1: I think this is an excellent book for an overview of Great Danes and the considerations in deciding to own one. Making the decision to get a giant breed is a big one and this book is great for considering all that comes along with that. I would say it's better for people to read BEFORE deciding whether to buy a Great Dane to prepare and make sure you're up for all that's involved, but as far as a complete book for a Great Dane owner, I would recommend getting a book that has more specifics on the various topics rather than just an overview. This is NOT a one and only book for the Great Dane owner.
Summary 2: This was pretty good and i will use it as a reference, but i was a little frustrated with the book. Throughout almost the entire middle section instead of answering very important questions on the topic of the chapter, he would just say &quot;check with your great dane mentor for information on....&quot; - feeding, bloat, purchasing, etc, etc etc. I got this book to get this guys opinion not for him to tell me to check with someone else. I did think that the sections on training were good.
Summary 3: I found this book extremely helpful it cover just about everything. I strongly recomend it.
Summary 4: Great reference for first time Great Dane owners and adopters as we are. We have followedmany of the directives and will use this as a guide.
Summary 5: Great book for the price. A little high in shipping using Media Mail though."
0738708089,Sign of the Crescent,"Summary 1: This book starts out with an introduction to Taryn. Taryn has just lost her grandmother, and is suffering heart break because of the lost. Mean while teenagers are getting snatched by some unknown source, and going out at night for teens is getting riskier. There are people from the world, Neworld, whose job is to protect the teens from earth, Oldworld. Erick is one of those people. One night, when Erick is out trying to stop the kidnappings, he comes across Taryn. Erick is dispatched far away from Taryn, and her rescue seems impossible. When the Zumarian warrior, working for the bad guy, comes to take Taryn he grabs her. Whenever a Zummarian warrior grabs a person of the Oldworld they immediatly freeze, but Tary doesn't freeze when grabbed, Taryn fights back. Erick, who witnesses this, knows there is something different with Taryn, and goes to meet her. Erick and Taryn build a relationship over time, but one night Taryn is taken, and Erick decides it is time to attack the bad guy. Taryn is confronted with the bad guy and learns that he is her father. Taryn is presented with a choice that will decide the future for everyone. Taryn is left with the choice to choose love or power, and whichever way she chooses she betrays someone.This book is about choosing. Throughout the book the characters are met with choices. Taryn faces the choice between love and power, while Erick faces the choice between following the rules and following the heart. The choices the characters choose are pretty alike, but one does the right thing while the other does the thing that goes against what is considered right. I thought the book was interesting because it showed how heavily the choices weighed upon each character. It showed how the characters ended up at least trying to do the right thing, but how their choice always seemed to out weigh the other choice. The characters were interesting together because one character knew what was going on while the other was learning. The characters were also interesting because they were different. One of the characters was a warrior, in perfect health, while the other was more of a thinker, who had to fight hearing loss and was battling a disease. Their differences extended deeper than that since one of the characters was born into a good family while the other was born into an evil family.The story itself was pretty good. The author did a very good job in describing the scenes in detail, and the thought processes that the author wrote for the characters were also detailed, and because of that the reader could get more of an insight into who the characters were. This book was a good book that could hold the readers interest easily and had main characters that you could easily like and antagonists that you hated but pitied.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, adn young adult book reviews and recommendations
Summary 2: Sign of the Crescent is a book my grandmother gave me years ago. Admittedly, when I read it back then, it confused me and I could not quite understand what was going on.Fast-forward to the present day.Now that my mind can comprehend the words, I have read the book multiple times and enjoy it thoroughly. The book follows interesting characters in an intriguing plot that mixes new with old, and powerful with the weak. As you progress through the book, you learn more about what happened as rules are broken and secrets unveiled.Readers will be drawn into the story and left with the urge to keep reader - to visualize more of what happens after the final climax.This Fantasy novel takes what could have been a clich&eacute; and turns it into something more. Debbie Federici did well to keep readers interested and make things understandable, despite there being a fairly large cast later in the novel.My only problem with the book was that at times, the pace slowed to a crawl. At those times, it was only the intrigue that kept me going - the need to know what would happen and how things would end.Even with the issue in pacing at times, this is a book I gladly recommend to anyone interested in a good fantasy story that takes a new approach on the already known.Pick it up if you have the chance. You won't regret it.
Summary 3: Mature adult here, didn't even realize when I grabbed this book that it was meant for teens... I can see how it would be appropriate for teens, but thoroughly enjoyed it! Easy to glide through (though I'm usually a pretty quick reader) but made for a very enjoyable weekend afternoon! I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy stories. A bit more simplistic (but not overly so) than many of the fantasy novels out there, but sometimes that's refreshing when your brain is tired. The primary characters are engaging, and the author makes you care about them quickly... all in all a fun read.
Summary 4: Heed the School Library Journal Review. It said everything that I would have. I am amazed that this book was even published, much less picked up by an editor.... And it makes me wonder what kind of editor would say that this ""book"" passed muster. I have read many books, all far more deserving of a read than this one, so I feel that I can say with utmost certainty that the writing quality is poor, the characters are all stock, the ""drama"" and ""secrecy"" is laughable at best, you can smell all the plot ""twists"" coming from a gazillion light-years away, and you have to marvel at the main character's slowness at ""interpreting"" the ""symbols"" in her very transparent dreams and the ""meaningful coincidences"" that occur throughout the frayed plot. When I picked this book up, I was looking for a good fantasy\adventure read with some romance tossed in. What I got was a bunch of words thrown together that even a first-grader could read through easily--but I wouldn't dare insult one by giving him\her this book to read at all. I'm even hesitant to give it away or sell it second-hand because I don't want anyone else to waste their time reading it. I realize that my review sounds hostile and cruelly blunt, but while it may be that, it is also honest."
0451210573,Natural Menopause Remedies: Which Drug-Free Cures Really Work,"Summary 1: This book was truly inspiring. Instead of giving us the same bunch of hogwash about all the things that might help you through menopause, it lists only the things that have been clinically proven with good scientific studies. And the author manages to get this complex (and important) information across with lots of warmth and personal presence. You really feel like you're in her living room talking to her about what really helps get rid of hot flashes or insomnia or a lack of sex drive -- not just what we've already read about over and over.
Summary 2: I loved this book because it was so easy to read and right to the point. It didn't beat around the bush with a lot of &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;perhaps&quot; quallifiers - it just told you what works for different symptoms of menopause. It didn't recommend everything, just the supplements or other alternate approaches that science says really work. I've read lots of books on menopause, and this was by far the best.
Summary 3: This well-written, conversational and sensible book provides helpful advice for the perimenopausal woman. Addressing each of the major areas affected by menopause (hormonal, cardiovascular, cognitive/emotional, bone health), Ms. Taylor provides sound, referenced explanations and explores intervention options with the reader including evaluations of efficacy and safety. This book is the Honest Herbal of non-pharmaceutical menopause therapies. I whole-heartedly recommend it not only to women approaching/undergoing menopause, but to their families as well. Additionally, it is an excellent resource for health care practitioners working in the area of women's health who would like to offer their patients non-pharmaceutical intervention options."
0385411839,Where the Rivers Ran Backward,"Summary 1: Bill Merritt's account of his service with the 65th Engineer Battalion, 25th Division, in 1968, never got the attention it deserved, but it is one of the best memoir-style books to have emerged from the Vietnam War. The writing is rich and layered, the dialogue utterly real, the stories frank and fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in what Vietnam was like for a junior enlisted man, and a must for any serious reader of Vietnam War literature.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in what Vietnam was like for a junior enlisted man, and a must for any serious reader of Vietnam War literature.
Summary 3: A fine memoir of a Vietnam veteran. My brother met the author and secured a signed copy for me which I immediately devoured. It is highly readable and engrossing. I especially enjoyed the attention to language; specifically the terms and names. Merritt uses them effectively to put us into his time and environment.
Summary 4: I was in country two years. Bill Merritts book has refreshed my memories of the Cu Chi and Phu Cuong periods. I was on the bridge with Bill Merritt just minutes before it blew. We played chess, I walked away, it was a full moon, what could happen? Boom, right behind me it went up. He remembered the names of our Chinese/Vietnamese soldier friend-""Ha""-and our housegirl ""Loi"". I have many pictures of them both. Ha was the best RVN soldier I ever met, and I met quite a few.Bill's memory of dialogue and events is astounding,very entertaining, but sometimes doesn't fit with my own. I believe I am one of the characters in his book. Check out the photo in my profile. I loved the book and have to give Bill his propers, even though the memories of all that subsequently happened are not good. Many of my fellow countrymen/soldiers were hurt that night, killed or injured, and many in the months to follow.I had to argue constantly about getting resupplied with enough ammo and safe explosives to throw into the river. I refused to use the pound blocks of tnt or c4 w/det cord or to have my men use them. The poor GIs who had to light fuses inserted into pound blocks of tnt suffered the most as they did not know if the cigarette/lighter they would use to light the fuse actually lit the fuse as it did not sputter or flash like the ones in the movies. Consequently I saw many soldiers blow their hands&arms; off or get blown into the barb wire protecting the columns holding up the bridge. There they would hang like a bug in a spider web of razor bladed concertina, screaming their hearts out. It was impossible to pull them out, as we needed boats and wire cutters to get to them. I was finally allowed access to chopper resupplies of hand grenades & ammo when I asked my platoon commander to come to the bridge to argue with the first sargent who refused to resupply us with ammo. He put that first sgt in his place, and I enjoyed seeing ""Top"" eat his words, back down, and leave me the hell alone. He wasn't so outspoken when my 1st lt. got through with him. Thanks, Lt. Yamaguchi! A man willing to call a gook a gook.When the choppers would come in with nets full of ammo, c-rats, sundry boxes, I did not care about anything except getting resupplied with 50 cal ammo, 7.62 belts for my M-60, and multiple rounds for my grenade launcher, flares, HE and shot gun rounds, and, of course, my favorite, cases of grenades, so many, they would fill the jeep and cover the front hood, and unable to see over the cases of grenades, I would drive back to the bunker hanging out the driver's side and my buddy holding the grenades and ammo, keeping the cases and belts and boxes of ammo from sliding off the hood of the jeep.I would personally blow 6 cases of grenades. We would have contests to see how far we could throw them before they exploded, or throw them so high they would air burst out over the water and wake soldiers who though on guard duty might be sleeping or sometimes holding 10-12 grenades in my arms with all the pins pulled, I would just let them drop into the drink. Ploop, Ploop,ploop ploop.., wait 4 seconds, rumble, (louder, Louder, Louder!) and so on nightly, I won't even describe what it was like to shoot continually at junk floating downriver toward the bridge-just blast it with whatever you're holding, 50 cal, M60, M16, we even had guns from WW2 era, a burp gun which shot 45 cal and had a giant breech which absorbed all the shock from the recoil, but it was a bear to load and the mags weighed a ton compared to the 16, but more accurate up close, no climb to the barrel on full auto.If the infantry guards were dozing in the bunkers on the bridge catwalk, I would drop a little surprise in the water just below the bunkers, making the bridge feel like it was being blown up one more time! The bridge would rock back and forth from the multiple explosions emanating from the deep Saigon river. They would shout and scream some even coming up on the bridge to pound the crap out of me. I had my grenade launcher held like a baseball bat saying ""c'mon if you want..."" they would back down warning me they would ""tell the captain!"".I never heard a word, and continued with my nightly fourth of July celebrations with multiple forms of explosives into the river listening to AFVN radio out of Saigon, sometimes dancing/bebopping on the bridge to various soul songs like the Dells-""There Is"", ""Stay in my Corner"";the Temps-""I Wish It Would Rain"" or ""25 Miles"", skipping rope, doing push ups to stay awake on guard all night, thinking how I would be in shape for the Golden Gloves in Lowell, Mass when I got back summer of '70, still so long off though I had been in country 4 months when the bridge was hit, and I had 19 to go;it seemed endless, and the guys most of them coped with alcohol or dope, and it was iteresting to see the cliques emerge-dopers who minded their own business,watching the flares, outgoing artillery missions, 50 cal tracer rounds, and far away jets bombing and strafing, while the boozers were on fire with bottles of rum, vodka, canadian club or johnny walker black mixing it with packaged/presweetened lime KoolAid or coke, sometimes getting frustrated and violent with each other or anyone who looked at them askew. I actually knew one fellow sgt. who pounded on his vehicle with his M-16 that had that huge site profile at the end of the barrel. He just stood there in the road at dusk mad as hell at something pounding on the jeep hood with his rifle seemingly trying to beat a hole in the hood of his jeep, muttering..""SofaBitch! I quit, csuckn' bastards.."" apparently one of his own guys had some complaints about him, embarassing him in front of the platoon. He wanted to pound the guy to pulp, but had to eat the embarassment.I was almost courtmartialed after falling asleep on guard. A major inspecting the lines had to wake me up as my head fell on the horn of the steering wheel of my jeep. I had passed out listening to the rain hit the canvas over my head, thanking God I had shelter from the monsoons, but it was so soothing...It was impossible to sleep during the day due to the construction on the bridge.Where we slept under the bridge was like a thruway with all kinds of civilian, RVN soldiers, GIs roaming through our sleeping area,enginiers repairing the bridge and trying to take over our shrinking space under the bridge. The Vietnames soldiers eating cooked rat with their families was bad enough. They had to go. Plus the choppers and patrol boats would land just over the sandbag walls blowing the area into a fine dust storm. The dust would settle on our sweaty skin creating a scummy film as most of us never wore our uniforms. Then we would try to bathe it away in the river, but the river contained every kind of bacteria in Southeast Asia and we would come down with the worst skin infections one could ever imagine. Things would never heal and we had the Phu Cuong Itch. Some only cleaned up with the ""Whore's Bath"" in an empty steel pot. Lucky for me and my guys we could eventually go back to Cu Chi to base camp to get a shower.Getting back to sleeping on guard-because we lived in such a high foot traffic area and the noise of the generator next to my cot the size of a truck with no muffler, it was hard to sleep during the day and we were up all night guarding the bridge and other things. During the rainy season I would sit at the highest point of the bridge in the open jeep with the canvas roof. The sound of the monsoon rain reminding me of fall rains in NH sitting in front of apple wood fires, remembering feelings of home. I did not hear a thing until the major shook me awake to the sound of my jeep horn blaring. I had fallen forward with my head leaning on the horn totally unaware of the noise of the horn. He was mad,threated me with courtmartial but gave me another chance, and I stayed at the bridge for 8 months, being left alone to do my job as various infantry companies rotated through.We guarded two bridges, another further down the road and loaded with mines in the road. Any time we went there we had to be sure it had been checked by mine sweepers, guys walking in front of a tank swinging the apparatus which looked like a metal detector with head phones. As the book mentions we did have that run in with the mine. After being up all night guarding the small bridge and fighting off the rats attracted to the c-ration garbage dumped by the potsmokers (it was good weed) and others, my partner Regdos wanted to return to the big bridge where they served real eggs. I said ""yeah,after the mine sweepers go by.."" Finally, I wanted the eggs too and we took off, I was driving the jeep. The dirt roads were covered in oil to keep the dust down but it also made it easier to hide a mine. A coffee can full of c4 plastic explosive would total any vehicle. Alongside this road to Cu Chi on both sides were signs warning of mine fields, dead bodies of civilians who had been traveling on the roads before the sweepers had gone by blown into these fields by the VC. Because of the mines and razor wire the bodies were left where they lay next to scrap Lambretta taxis. On our return to the bridge approximately 6:30 AM I had warned Regdos that we would be flying as I wanted to be going as fast as I could if we hit anything. Out of the morning fog in the middle of this narrow dirt road was a huge tire taking up most of the road. Unable to straddle the tire I hit the brakes and cranked the steering wheel sliding horizontal over the tire without touching it. Did someone up there like me? I looked down from the drivers side, saw an ammo box in the center of the tire with wires leading off into the village at the side of the road. We had slid exactly far enough to turn the wheels back in the direction we were headed and took off. We told the mine sweepers, when they returned, they said it was not there. I shrugged, maybe just another close call.The small bridge, aka Cau Ba Bep, is another story, and another river tributary, alot like ""Apocalypse Now"" in its physicality, and the attitude when one is on the river and going up canals...Is it fun or is it battle,probably both. Try going up one of those canals as they get smaller and smaller waiting for the VC to pitch a grenade or RPG fired into us point blank...Sometimes it's a turkey shoot on our part, sometimes ""the Bar eats you,"" regards to the Dude.Base Camp commandoes and officers looking to cause a ruckus would come out to inspect our position;I would debate with them why I had two of everything I was issued, you know, one for inspection and one for fighting. Why didn't they understand? C'est la vie, c'est la guerre, l'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace! Aux Armes! Ride to the sound of the guns! Hey, Bill, you left us too soon. Bienvenue au NH, a votre sante'!"
1568027222,Exercising Essential Statistics,"Summary 1: Thank you for answering my questions and sending the product in a timely manner as it was described to me.
Summary 2: Many of the practice questions were easy, but some didn't make any sense, luckily the professor didn't grade on whether questions were right or wrong. In the end the book did it's job: A- for the class.
Summary 3: This book is terrific for someone who has no knowledge of statistics. It offers s student the opportunity to grasp statistical concepts easily.
Summary 4: The workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course. VERY UNHAPPY. I wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software, but only to send it back. I need the workbook for my class, and the class is in its fourth week. I have since ordered the software from the manufacturer.Jim McShane"
0070451001,Foundations of Psychological Testing,"Summary 1: The authors do an excellent job of bringing together the essential information without overwhelming the reader. The book has many features which help the student bring the information together--outlines, study tables, and excellent review exercises. I highly recommend this book to any teacher or student teaching or taking a psychology class in tests and measurements.
Summary 2: [[ASIN:0070451001 Foundations of Psychological Testing]This is one the most easily written book, explain with clarity all the foundations of psychological testing. I purchase the book for research and help me with my assigments. I did not buy the one that University of Phoenix recomended because of the reviews. However, I believe this one is better and cover the same information.
Summary 3: A great text on this topic"
0486208141,Say It in Norwegian (Dover Language Guides Say It Series),"Summary 1: To have a small phrase book like this one is essential. This book goes over the essential phrases, commands, and responses in order to get by in Norway. The best part is that it gives different responses so one can express exactly how they're feeling in a given situation. In addition it details phrases dealing with the hotel room, dinner, police, post office officials, shopping, and more. Although the book is primarily meant to be for travelers it can be an excellent tool for someone learning a language. It can also act as a handy book that can be kept in your pocket when you have a spare minute to review. For the price, something like this shouldn't be passed up on. The pronunciation guide in the phrase book is more than helpful. I also advise that you eventually supplement this book with an audio course book. If you're planning a trip for Norway or are learning the language this is a solid purchase.
Summary 2: I bought this book as I am starting to learn Norwegian. I never find phrase books a very useful way to learn a language or even very useful when travelling as I prefer to learn the language properly rather than in fragmented sound bytes.Nevertheless, this book is quite good with a wide range of situations with 1366 entries. It has phrases and expressions as well as indvidual words and entry is numbered making it easier to retreive words and phrases. Its pages are not coloured or glossy like the Berlitz but is small enough for a shirt pocket. There is no CD but it does the job. If I were sitting at a bus stop or in a tram, this would be a good companion. Combine this with a Collins Norwegian-English dictionary on my iPhone, and it is even better.
Summary 3: This little book is only 5.3 x 3.3 inches and about 0.3 inches thick. It has many useful words and phrases with a good (but not excellent) pronunciation guide. Stick it in your shirt pocket on the outside chance you meet a Norwegian who doesn't speak English.
Summary 4: This is a perfect size to fit in a pocket or purse and carry along while traveling in Norway. Often not needed, however, because it seems that everyone in Norway speaks fluent English!Say It in Norwegian (Dover Language Guides Say It Series)
Summary 5: A bit out of date; soooo funny, because I don't think I'll be using words and phrases like ""typewriter"" or ""will you close the porthole"" although it's charming to see. It's very helpful however, and I'm excited to have it!!"
0829814094,Pot Likker: Stories for Teachers and Learners,"Summary 1: The editors Larry and Deborah Coleman have done agreat job of compiling stories that relate to real life situations. As I began to read the stories I felt as if I was a part of what was being said. I picked up this book with the intent of reading only a few stories and found the book magnetic! I was drawn to continue reading, I enjoyed not only one story but allof the ones that I read. They made me reflect on situations in my life and allowed me to see myself. This bok is a refreshing collection of stories, that provide something for everyone. I recommend that every that every educator, parent and instructor have this as part of their collection. If this were a pot of soup, I'd be tipping the pot to be sure to get every drop.
Summary 2: What an appropriate name for a book of nourishing stories, those from the heart and parables of the spirit. I read Pot Likker in a few hours, savoring the lessons learned, the insights shared, and the fortitude expressed. Many of the stories exemplify the line from a spiritual, ""I Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around!"" The contributors all evince a right-mindedness, that sisterly and brotherly love we so desperately need to demonstrate to one another.Hopefully, Larry and Deborah Peaks Coleman, the editors of Pot Likker, will edit more collections, for I am hooked!

B0008A411G,Paul Bunyan,"Summary 1: Esther Shephard knows how to spin a yarn. These stories sound so conversational that they're great to read aloud or in one's head. Young or old, anyone interested in American folklore should pick up a copy of this book. It may not be suited for the youngest of kids (there is one part where somebody's brains come out, but then the cook replaces them with batter), but it is very enjoyable and overall very tame. Two thumbs up!
Summary 2: Growing up I heard a lot of folk tales about Paul Bunyan. I was very amused by those stories. This book puts them all together for me. Very enjoyable to read. Lots of fun in these pages.
Summary 3: You know all about Paul Bunyan right? Well think again. Here are 21 tales of the legendary logger that you must read. Did you know he `made"" the Grand Canyon by dragging a spike behind him on his way home one day! Or did you know that his bunkhouses were so big the loggers had to use parachutes to get out of the bed! Oh My! What tall tales await you in this short story collection!What did you like or not like about the book?The illustrations helped you to visualize the stories.Anyone that loves tall tales will enjoy this book."
B000H78YWC,"The Mystery of the Flying Express (Hardy Boys, Book 20)","Summary 1: After the complexity of the previous Hardy Boys book, ""The Disappearing Floor,"" I was ready for a bit simpler story, and this book delivers. This time the mystery centers on the Flying Express, a hydrofoil that is just entering service on Barmet Bay. Someone is out to prevent the Flying Express from entering service. Who is behind these attempts?This story is somewhat interesting in the Chet Morton's new hobby, astrology, plays a critical part in the story. Chet's hobbies have often played a part in Hardy Boys books, but in this book his hobby is central to capturing the criminals.The Hardys discover an unusual group of criminals in this mystery, including one who does everything based on his horoscope. The boys also encounter a businessman who seems as though he might have something to do with the mystery, but how, and why?The Hardy boys have frequently encountered criminals who have put them into danger, in addition to the danger they often encounter on their own. This time the criminals do things that could endanger dozens of lives as they try to stop the Flying Express from crossing Barmet Bay.This story is interesting with elements that are educational and enjoyable. The story is paced well and is reasonably easy to follow. While I enjoyed the complexity of the previous story, ""The Disappearing Floor,"" the relative simplicity of the story line in this book was welcomed. Further, though the story line is somewhat simple, there was sufficient complexity to keep the story interesting.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading.
Summary 2: The original 1941 version of The Flying Express was a poorly written book in certain respects. The book is very slightly disjointed in places and perhaps more to the point it contains several glaring errors all too well known to most Hardy enthusiasts - ie: The incorrect names given for Mrs. Hardy & Chief Collig. That said and those things aside this was a pretty good book. As I child I held this book in high esteem. It is a story about spies using a train called the Flying Express. It is the brothers task to find the spies and their camp and bring them to justice. It is too bad the book contains several errors because otherwise it had a great plot and was an enjoyable read. More accurately I rate it a 3.4 star, the story a 4 star, the errors within a 2 star. RATED B-REVISION: The 1970 revision - from memory was a dud. I may not be the best person to rate the revision. I can simply say I read it once and was not impressed. Its worth reading, but ranks among the bottom dwellers.
Summary 3: Sneaking around, discovering what other teens or adults were up to, solving crimes, ahh, I loved this series.I read the entire series as a kid, and loved it. It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds. I only learned as an adult that Franklin W Dixon was a pen name used by several different authors, but the series had some great stories. I still enjoy a good mystery.Paul Buckner,author of ""From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom.""
Summary 4: this series is wonderful for youth who love the thrill of action. ive had a great time reading them myself.
Summary 5: This book right here is very suspenseful for a Hardy Boy book, and that is exactly why I liked this book. You wanna know what brought my hair standing to my head? The part where the airplane was flying right over the ship. So if you like a really suspenseful book Hardy Boys style... this one's for you baby :D."
0521603536,"Charity, Philanthropy, and Civility in American History","Summary 1: I am puzzled by the acidity of the review by ""J Onyx"", who contrasts the supposedly unscholarly and ""Marxist"" authors of this collection with the scholarly ""gentleman"" Robert Bremner, who wrote various works on the history of American Philanthropy. J Onyx even speculates that these historians waited until Professor Bremner was gone before they published their writings.I was one of Professor Bremner's graduate students at Ohio State and assisted him with his revision of his classic work American Philanthropy. Bob Bremner was indeed a gentleman, and he treated other scholars with an irenic spirit even when he disagreed with them. It is impossible for me to imagine Bob Bremner being so uncharitable of other scholars as J Onyx, or engaging in such an acerbic and inaccurate misrepresentation of a work.This is an important collection of well-researched essays. Anybody interested in the role of philanthropy in American history must begin with this volume.
Summary 2: Well I didn't find much interest in this book but I did learn lots of new things from it. Each chapter kind of contains the same info as another chapter which is why I felt like I was reading things over n over
Summary 3: wish I had a better professor teaching the material. This is a great primer to the history of charity and philanthropy. I used it as a text for a Masters level course. The book taught me more than its presentation in the course, but... it happens..."
0312306288,Grandma's Wartime Baking Book: World War II and the Way We Baked,"Summary 1: The previous reviewer did a wonderful job in summarizing the chapters of this book so I will refrain from repeating and instead will say that this book is a ""good read"".There are those out there that like to occasionally peruse cookbooks (and you know who you are) but in this case there is more to think about than whether you have all the ingredients on hand. It is interesting to contemplate how much WWI and WWII affected our culture and how adaptive our forebearers were when shortages occurred. There are plenty of examples of propaganda, ration cards and excerpts from women's magazines to keep one up at night or dawdling at the kitchen table over coffee.Enjoy!ps -- I have made the cocoa icing and the marshmellow topped cake and both came out well.
Summary 2: This is a great cookbook for busy cooks. I purchased it because I prefer to cook my meals a bit old fashioned. This book has wonderful recipes. I also like how this book talks about some of the history from the war and rationing. Those times remind me a bit of now. Prices are going up and we need to go back to basics. Thank you for this good book. I received the book quickly and looking forward to cooking out of it everyday.
Summary 3: I've been teaching ""A Separate Peace"" in my sophomore English classroom for many years and have always decorated my room to fit the wartime era of that novel (1942-1943), using movie posters, newspaper front pages, propaganda posters as well as playing music of the era. This year I chose to also bring the reality of rationing to my students and went in search of a cookbook to do the job. ""Grandma's Wartime Baking Book"" did just that.In addition to dozens of recipes, the author also provides plenty of stories, insights, and excerpts from period publications. For example, here's a conservation tip from the 1943 publication ""Your Share"": 'Save fresh fluid milk....rinse cream bottles with milk, and use with milk; rinse milk bottles with water, and use in cooking.' Evidently, the frugal homemaker didn't waste anything!I haven't tried very many recipes yet, but I did bake a couple batches of cookies to try and stress to my students what rationing was all about. I first made the carrot cookies on page 74, and then I tried the chocolate rolled oats cookies on page 75. Both of these recipes used no sugar--honey was used as a sweetener. And while both recipes only called for two cups of flour (remember sugar and flour were in limited supply during wartime), they both yielded the four dozen cookies stated in the recipe. I should point out that the carrot cookie batter was almost cake batter thin, but they turned out terrific--and my students loved them, too.
Summary 4: I bought this for my daughter as a gift, but when it arrived, I had a hard time parting with it!I especially enjoyed all the history in the book, very facinating, and have made quite a few recipes from it, all turning out wonderfully.Beautiful coffee table book as well."
0879305916,The Reel World: Scoring for Pictures,"Summary 1: This book not only gives you the information you were after when you bought the book in the first place. It is also joy to read. There is a perfect balance between raw information, interviews with the biggies (John Williams, et cetera), and tips on how to think about film music. This is NOT just another fluff book that the author wrote simply because his last three scores were rejected and he needed the money. If you do not find this book to be incredibly helpful then you have either been making film music for 30 years already (even then I find it hard to believe that you didn't find it helpful), or you are just nutts!
Summary 2: At first, I was very pleased with ""Scoring for Pictures"", but after having read the whole book I am somewhat disappointed. The book covers so many different aspects, ranging from composition and conducting an orchestra to setting up your studio, professional conduct and building a career, it's destined to be a bit shallow in each area. It certainly makes good points in each area, but I would prefer more depth in the areas specific to film scoring, and less ""general advise"".
Summary 3: Not much to say besides, I love this book. Had it not been so jammed with great info, I would have been more turned off by the typos and somewhat disjointed nature of the read. However, if you're trying to learn the basics of film and tv score, check it out.
Summary 4: As a full time working film composer I am always trying to improve on my knowledge about the business as well as the technical aspects of this tough yet gratifying craft. Jeff Rona's Reel World is a great to read, Un-boring view into the world of the film composer. At many points I must confess, I couldn't let it go out of my hands. He uses many of his own case scenarios as a very active film composer to enlight us on a few lessons learned and succeeds on bringing on several points missed on most books if this genre. I had a Reel Blast. Either you are just jumping into this, or you have been on it and just want to make sure you are doing things right, this book is a must have, hats-off piece for your career.
Summary 5: Like many musicians, I have a great interest in film scores and, if it weren't so tough to make a good living at, I'd love to have pursued scoring to picture as a career. This book, however, is a great introduction to the world of film scores and covers all the bases at an introductory level. You'll learn about the business side (dealing with clients, sticky politics between directors and producers, etc), the technical side (the equipment you'll need, what it all does, etc), and the musical side (developing themes and so on). He also includes interviews with several other prominent film composers, which is great because he asks the questions other musicians would ask.Rona's style is quite approachable, as evidenced by the column he's written for Keyboard magazine for years. In fact, my only criticism of the book might be that some of the chapters are taken directly from his past columns and the result is sometimes a choppy transition from one chapter to the next. Overall, though, that's a pretty small nit to pick about what is otherwise a great introduction to the world of film scoring."
1587610779,Hit Below the Belt : Facing Up to Prostate Cancer,"Summary 1: I read this book because of the quotes I'd read in a nutrition newsletter that seemed to capture the mind-set that was essental if one is to deal with prostate cancer successfully. I'm a pediatrcian, like the author, who was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and had a radical prostatectomy with good results. I was hoping for more wisdom from reading the book, but found most of it only in the introduction. The author's obsessive pursuit of knowledge in order to make his decision fit his personality, but perhaps not many others. His anecdotal comments about the surgical option are just that, and far from what I experienced. I'm afraid that many of his own fears will only serve to cause more anxiety to readers than is necessary and prevent them from &quot;coming to peace&quot; with prostate cancer and the decision they make. For those men who have decided on radiation and seeds this book might be helpful. But, for those seeking a balanced view of the treatment options this book will not be useful.
Summary 2: I was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and am about to undergo a radical prostatectomy in about 6 days. I was disappointed in the book and found it amazing how many physicians and other professionals were consulted before the author determined or decided on his course of treatment. I had hoped to have a more balanced read and this book made me really wonder whether I have opted for what is best for me. I am not a doctor and did not have access to the professionals the author had access to. Fortunately, I first read a book by Dr. Patrick C. Walsh who developed the &quot;nerve-sparing&quot; technique before I read this book. At least I have some peace of mind that I have made the right decision.
Summary 3: HIT BELOW THE BELT is the true story of a medical doctor's diagnosis of having Prostate Cancer, and his journey of the many twists and turns of seeking treatment for his conditon. A no holds barred book about a very common ailment, that every man over 40 should be required to read, together with their mates. Told in non medical lingo, the book is a fast read."
0823031276,More Fantasy Art Masters: The Best Fantasy and Science Fiction Artists Show How They Work,"Summary 1: More Fantasy Art Masters isn't just another collection of fantasy work by great artists...it is, but it's much more. Rarely in fantasy art collections do you get a chance to get a glimpse behind the creation of the art. That is exactly what More Fantasy Art Masters does. The book spotlights ten very talented, yet very diversified artists and lets them provide commentary on their own work. Fans now can get inside their heads to know their motivations behind a piece. What perhaps those novices among us may have viewed as random placements of items in a painting, of color and light is actually very carefully planned from the beginning. In addition the artists provide interesting insights into their own careers.We'll see how colors are chosen to present interesting contrasts between foreground and background and to set the proper mood of the piece. For example a Keith Parkinson painting, (one of my favorites) shows a couple of Orcs riding on horseback through a snow covered forest. The trees devoid of leaves and nearly of life provides an austere, grim setting as the pair seem hellbent on some type of evil quest. Most interesting and previously something I never fully realized is how color is used to very subtly convey moods and emotions, almost on a subliminal level. To hear the artists tell it in their own words sets off a bell in your head as you truly grasp what they hoped to convey in the painting. It's quite fascinating. The artists also go into great detail on the tools and materials they used for the works on display. Some work soley in one type of medium whether it's oil, acrylic, water color, digital, etc, while others are quite comfortable in combining several different types of paint.The artists included in the book are Keith Parkinson, Anne Sudworth, Judith Clute, Phil Hale, Ian Miller, J.K. Potter, Greg Spalenka, Dave Seeley, Darrel Anderson, and John Harris. The book really does a great job of spotlighting an eclectic array of talent.Reviewed by Tim Janson
Summary 2: A little frustrated with the seller on this one. I bought the book and realized I got the wrong one, okay, my fault, but then I tried to contact them to return it and they just ever so not subtly refused to contact me back. Tried a couple times. This book is not good at all. I have the first one, which is amazing, but this one is so not aesthetically appealing to me. The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely. Maybe that would appeal to some, or a lot, I don't know, but for me my work is tighter and this book doesn't inspire me like the first one. Overall, though, seller sucks!
Summary 3: If your looking for an art book with more art similar to the cover, Keith Parkinson, look elsewhere. There is very little sword and magic fantasy contained inside. This book was a major let down. Parkinson's art is maybe the first four to five pages, after that the pages would best be used right before a flush."
1573833665,Collected Plays,"Summary 1: How great that this book is back in print. Now I can quote my favorite Charles Williams line, spoken by the skeleton in one of these plays: ""The price of heaven, hell or earth is the same: always a broken heart, sometimes a broken neck."" Lines like that are why we keep reading.Mention Charles Williams' plays, and immediately someone comes up with more objections than even to his novels. Let's admit the plays are flawed so the critics will depart satisfied and we can lie back and read them. That indefineable, maddening something quietly lurking at the corners of the novels rages through the plays.T.S. Eliot, in the view of many, took language as far as it can go in ""The Wasteland"" and ""Four Quartets"". Charles Williams doesn't make the journey; he just begins on the other side. The skeleton and other characters stumble dazed as if through the debris of bombed-out London, scavenging through the detrius of words. CW lived outside of his own time, which is why he has become so relevant in ours. For the form of that age was already passing away. The long, dark night of modernism over and done, the pre-modern and post-modern reach and touch one another, as blinking in the dawn we stumble from the rubble.
Summary 2: I can't say how pleased I am to discover this back in print (I have a rather expensive used copy). I am a huge fan of Charles Williams, and this book is one of my favorites of his, along with the Taliessin poems and All Hallows' Eve-- with the added benefit that it isn't as impenetrable as the Taliessin poems often are. Thomas Cranmer of Canterbury alone is worth (to me) getting the book for, with its sympathetic yet unsparing (even harsh at times-- Cranmer's last scene, ooh) picture of Cranmer mixed with haunting cascading language. Seed of Adam is kind of cool with its rather unorthodox portrayal of Joseph and Adam; The House by the Stable and its sequel are just fun. Terror of Light is perhaps my favorite after Cranmer; the portrayal is just so... right, for example Thomas's rejoicing in rationality and Saul's misplaced (but understood and forgiven) judgmentalism, and Judas's (possibly heretical?) authority even in damnation. The only play I don't love is Judgement at Chelmsford, which is a bit too formal for my taste, with not enough plot, although I'm sure that actually seeing it probably works better than reading it.If you like plays, and you like Williams' other work, then I recommend this. Of course, there are lots of people out there who don't like his erudite and casually-theological/supernatural style, which I do quite understand, and those probably wouldn't like this either. I would also have to say don't read all the plays at once, as he has some language tricks he *really likes*, and reading them three times in a row is a bit tiresome.
Summary 3: For Charles Williams Words are everything. Why? We are not God and we don't live in heaven, so Words are the things we must stand by. A Word is much more than an utterance said, or written. It is, for Williams, an act of adoration--or blasphemy. It is the stuff that fills up life and makes it human. Or not. That, I think, is the key to Williams plays. Words do not so such signify as exist. They are bricks. Word upon Word, they build up patterns of being, real or an illusion, something or nothing, an arrangement of truth or lies, fashioned by Words uttered--and lived. God's or yours."
0873498305,Toys & Prices 2005 (Toys and Prices),"Summary 1: The Krause book of Toys and Prices has long been a favorite of mine. It is comprehensive, layed out well in its format and sections, as well as providing informative information on the hobby or business of toy collecting. Each year Krause does a better job of including more modern day toys as there are so many companies now producing toys specifically for a collectors market. Like any good book the Krause guide provides manufacturer, year and of course condition based prices.While No one guide can ever be totally comprehensive, Krause is one I buy every two years or so along with the Schroeder toy price guide. Those two I think provide the best wealth of information and accuracy of any toy price guides.
Summary 2: Browse through favorite childhood toys and learn just how much they're worth now in the new twelth edition offering the latest updates in what is justifiably considered to be the toy bible for serious collectors and antique dealers -- Toys & Prices 2005. While small black and white photos and a sampling of color photos are included, the meat of Toys & Prices 2005 lie in alphabetically arranged listings organized into 23 main categories, from games and lunch boxes to space toys and more. Three price ranges reflect different condition ratings: especially valuable considering it's a medium which typically is difficult to preserve from young players.
Summary 3: This was a complete disappointment. They reduced the size of the book from 8 "" by 11"" to 7"" by 10"". This in itself is not so bad, but they reduced all the information in this book as well. They no longer cover any antique toys at best they only deal in vintage / classic toys. If your ideas of antique toy cars are Red Line Hotwheels you will like this book. If you are looking for Aircraft, American Paper Toys, Animal Drawn, Banks, Dollhouses and Miniature Furniture, Erector Sets, Farm Toys, Lionel Trains, Movie, Radio & Television Toys, Ramp Walkers, Schoenhut, Ships, Soldiers, Sparklers and Plunger Toys, Steam Toys, Wooden Toys, Cast Iron Vehicles and anything else before the 60's forget it! This has been reduced to nothing more than a baby boomer's toy guide. If you enjoy Antique Toy World, this book is not for you! If you like Toy Shop Magazine, well that is all this is. If you own the 11th Edition of Collecting Toys, hold on to it and get a second copy before you waste your money on this dreadful price guide.
Summary 4: I really thought this book would have been better updated from the previous year. It said it was...but not for the items I really wanted. And alot of the pricing was the exact same price as last year. I must say I was disapointed! :-(
Summary 5: Has the best variety of Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars as well as other diecast toy vehicles. Easy to use and understand. I highly recommend this book."
B000N7EUII,Clairvoyant,"Summary 1: This is a fantastic first novel. Mary Holt Allen not only captures the attention of her reader, but creates whole characters who carry our attention through their failures and successes. I found myself raging at characters only to fall back in love with them again later. And the story is far reaching and simply lovely. You will be thinking of these people as if they are your friends.
Summary 2: Finally, a novel with an interesting plot and well-developed characters! Allen has created rich characters with depth who are fascinating even when they behave despicably. The psychological complexity of D'arcy and Clair intrigued me - I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. This is a great read!
Summary 3: So many interesting characters; such moving and memorable scenes; and a clever narrative structure. Most impressive, I think,is Allen's richly inventive style. When she is being witty, ironic, nostalgic, romantic, or simply observant, she chooses just the right words."
1560974648,"Rebel Visions: The Underground Comix Revolution, 1963-1975","Summary 1: If you don't know what a comix is, maybe you should go on e-bay and buy yourself a copy of ZAP. While you still can.For those who are familiar with underground comic books, Patrick Rosenkranz has provided an amazing amount of background information about the creators and the times that produced what could be viewed as the trashiest and/or the most significant cultural artifacts of the second half of the 20th Century.Unlike previous histories and articles that simply reprint the more or less shocking comic pages and regurgitate the same old information, misinformation and opinions about the hippies and their graphic art, Rebel Visions is based on Mr. Rosenkranz own interviews and correspondence with the first wave of underground comix creators. In lengthy footnoted quotes, the artist/writers are finally allowed to tell their own strange and wonderful stories. And by following the stories organized in yearly chapters, I cames to understand something of the birth, bloom and demise of a phenomena that never made the transition to mainstream product or the 1980s.Rebel Visions also presents a significant amount of previously unpublished art for the connoisseur as well as an exhaustive index for the scholar.A word of warning: these comic books are not, and never were, intended for children. Most of the comix displayed and discussed in Rebel Visions were all about breaking taboos, about freedom of expression in the face of a repressive mainstream culture and not about tittilation. That came later. If you're interested in cartoons, graphic art, the counter culture, art, politics, the sixties, propaganda, freedom and censorship, as well as the usual sex, drugs and war, check it out.
Summary 2: At a time when a museum like the Guggenheim is reduced--as of this writing literally--to emptying the paintings from its walls to make ""room"" for a new exhibit of essentially next to nothing...a couple lying on the floor simulating a kiss and a few actors hired to ask long-suffering museum ""viewers"" annoyingly trite questions, such as ""what is progress?"" one begins to wonder what art historians of the future will think of late 20th century/early 21st century ""art."" What will become emblematic of our times when our times are long over? What will remain? Will nothing remain? I mean, you have to have something to see, right?""Rebel Visions"" makes a strong case without so much as raising the issue that what might very well be considered the most important art of our age was that being produced in the underground comix movement of the late 60s/early 70s, and which still continues in various incarnations today. As fine art moved from distortion to abstraction to minimalism to conceptualism to what some might argue is little more than flim-flam chicanery cloaked in elitist pseudointellectual gobbledygook, the disdained creators of such work as filled the pages of Zap! and Young Lust and Raw, to mention just a few, might in the meantime actually have been producing the ""real"" fine art of our time.As the so-called ""real"" artists turned their back and raised their noses at mere ""illustration,"" as they disdained the world of things in their canvases, and eventually disdained even the canvases themselves, as they ""thought"" up concepts instead of making images, and as they jockeyed for notoriety and government grants and invitations at all the swell parties, guys like R. Crumb, Robert Williams, S. Clay Wilson, Rick Griffin, and Art Spiegelman were drawing--yes, actually drawing--and the stuff they were drawing directly reflected and directly influenced the culture of late 20th century America.This shouldn't be all that surprising insofar as comic book elements made their way into the paintings of Warhol, Lichtenstein, and a whole bunch of other established fine art types. And before that you've got George Grosz and Max Beckmann. Take a look at their works and tell me you cant see them as akin to comic book panels. While the Julian Schnabels of the world party, the folks in the underground comix movement were actually doing the grunt work, walking the walk, and usually doing it without much appreciation and even less financial reward.Ach! Listen to me blabbering on about art history like EH Gombrich! I know nothing about it--what I know about art history couldn't fill an Idiot's Guide. What I do know is that I like blobs of paint thrown all over canvases as much as anyone; I swoon over string, nails, crushed cigarettes, dirt, poop, yesterday's lunch, and whatever else spray-painted over and glued onto billboards of plywood just as much as any art critic at the New York Times. I'll even nod appreciatively and chuckle knowingly along with the rest of the cognescenti when some downtown goofball paints a box of toothpicks white, sticks them in his nipples, and photographs them in the pitch-dark with a pinhole camera.In other words, I'm no phillistine!And I like minimalism...I love minimalism...as an anorectic, I am minimalism incarnate!But when it reaches the point when a museum empties itself out and asks people to pay admission to look at its bare walls I start to think I'm being taken for a fool.Listen, when ""fine art"" gets to the point that youre literally looking at nothing then the eye starts looking for stimulation. A superhero, a talking aardvark, one of those jittery Crumb characters...anything! When it's been so long since we saw anyone actually take a pencil and put marks on a page that resemble something we recognize that we begin to suspect that no one remembers how to do it, when art no longer seems to be making any attempt whatsoever to reflect and comment about our lives and the world we live in, when you need a card full of philosophical rigmarole written by some tenured academic to explain the blank space on the museum wall as a work of art and not, as you originally suspected, the spot left behind when a painting was removed for cleaning- then you begin to think that maybe when the fork in the art road was reached between representation and abstraction, we took the wrong road...or maybe just went too far down the right road.No matter. Just the fact that that the US government tried to shut down the publications featuring these mere schlockmeisters, these adolescent smut peddlers, these underground comic ""artists"" should tell you something.Aside from all that, ""Rebel Visions"" is just a lot of fun to read. And it's inspiring too. It makes one envious of the exciting times, the camarederie, and the commitment to engaged art that these guys had--and that is so lacking in today's art world. It shows you just how much people will do, the lengths they will go to do it, the sacrifices they'll make and for no discernible reward...if they love what they're doing.These guys were, and in many cases, still are, true artists of the first rank. And I wouldn't be at all surprised if in a hundred years from now they will be regarded among the foremost of our time.
Summary 3: This is an all-new edition, following the 2002 hbk, but Fantagraphics don't flaunt the fact. Why not? The hbk's long sold out and they could sell this all over again to nerds like me. Seriously (OK, I was serious), the hbk's heaven (snap 'em up, fellas, while you can) and this is bliss, apart from the curious (and curiously irritating) typography chosen for the headwords. Trina Robbins went, or was pushed, down the same route when A Century of.. morphed into The Great Women Cartoonists - the Women and the Comics original I've not seen - but we're not talking wacky here, fellas, this is serious art! Well, OK, fun art. Thanks a million, Gary (Groth)
Summary 4: I've seen several of these books and I think this is the best of the lot. I was very impressed with the total vision of the book."
0849902029,"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 3, Exodus","Summary 1: John Durham has provided a commentary in keeping with the rich tradition of the Word Biblical Commentary series. This 516 page commentary of Exodus presupposes the divine nature and inspiration of the text. While Durham gives information about sources of the finished text (Source Criticism), he approaches the text of a &quot;Canonical&quot; method, dealing with the text as it has come to us in its current form. His emphasis is on extracting the theological meaning of the text as opposed to defending or debunking various theories about the historicity of the book or particular events within it. For example, Durham doesn't get caught up in the debate about where the Red Sea was, or if this was a real historical event. He focuses on the meaning of that event for Israel, and the latter Christian community that would also consider the event apart of their faith heritage. Durham uses his own translation which provides a hosts of insights about the original language uses in the canon. This book will be a valuable resource for scholars who are searching for a reliable example of Canonical Criticism of Exodus. It will also be helpful for the pastor or Bible teacher who seeks greater theological understanding of Israel and her dramatic beginnings.
Summary 2: This volume is certainly required reading for an in-depth study of Exodus, but it is far from the only reading one will have to do to gain an informed knowledge of the text (this is true of every commentary, but especially true of Durham). Durham has many excellent points and is very quotable, particularly in the ""Form/Structure/Setting sections."" He interacts with a wide range of scholarship, which is helpful when doing research and trying to track down sources. His rendering of the Hebrew is also very good, and often more can be gleaned from his translation notes than in the actual ""Comment"" section.Unfortunately, the eager reader will also find considerable weaknesses. Although he mentions many views on the various issues, he rarely interacts with them. When he does, it often takes the form of simply dismissing the relevance of source critics for his purposes, rather than stating whether such views are probable or improbable, and if so, why. Also, his actual ""Comment"" sections are often woefully brief. More often than not, he groups three to six verses together, mentioning only one or two very general things about them, and then moves on.I have been helped by owning this commentary, particularly in finding ideas as to how to express what the text is saying. But if you want to really get a grasp on what is out there in Exodus, you will also need Enns, Sarna, and Childs (although the latter expresses a style that he has abandoned in recent years). Of course, even then you will still need a hefty amount of articles, etc, to really stay current (IVP's Dictionary of the Pentateuch is helpful). Durham's WBC by itself won't satisfy.
Summary 3: John I. Durham is a professor of Hebrew and Old Testament at Southeastern Baptist Seminary in North Carolina and the author of many scholarly works on Old Testament studies, including this volume in the Word Biblical Commentary Series.Of the Volumes in the Word Commentary that I've read or consulted, Durham's treatment of Exodus ranks among the best. One of Durham's greatest joys in preparing this commentary is the fact that he is required to make his own translation of the Hebrew text. His skill and enjoyment in this area certainly shine through as he jumps from wooden translations, to phrases that capture the spirit of the Hebrew (as opposed to the literal translation), with all his translation decisions explained in his translation notes. I learned more about Exodus than I expected from reading the translation and notes!As for the commentary proper, I am pleased to find that John Durham is easily one of the most readable contributors in the Word Series--he seems to know when a point needs more explanation and when he's ""beaten a dead horse."" I was also pleased to find that Durham, a respected scholar in an academic setting, was able to briefly cover ""Ivory Tower"" theories about certain portions of text, but then have the wisdom to put such theories in their proper place. He often mentions an academic controversy or debate, but then does a great service to the reader by putting the debated portion of Scripture in its proper theological context.This last point is perhaps the most valuable aspect of this commentary--the author never forgets the major theological themes and points in the book of Exodus. Whether the text is about Ten Plagues, Ten Commandments, Tabernacle Furniture, or rebellious Israelites, Durham always puts these portions of Scripture in context--theological and historical. He is one of a shrinking number of Old Testament authors that actually has respect for the textus receptus.While this commentary has many strengths, it also has some disappointing weaknesses. The first among these is the absense of any New Testament applications. Durham begins by pointing out that Exodus is the third most quoted OT book in the New Testament (running behind Psalms and Isaiah), yet does not make the connections between the Testaments. Whether a portion of Scripture is quoted by Jesus, Paul, etc., or whether Messianic prophesies are apparent (Passover, the table in the Tabernacle, Moses' arms being supported in a crucifix position, etc.), Durham ignores it.A second disappointed aspect of Durham's commentary is the amount of respect and credit (and space) he gives to source-criticism and ""later editors"" theories. At many points, it is very difficult to tell if Durham actually BELIEVES that some of the events recorded in Exodus actually happened. He clearly does not believe that Moses wrote the book, but he does believe that the Lord descended onto Mount Sinai, but he's not sure if the Tabernacle and furniture actually existed. It often seems as if Durham deliberately avoids taking a position on historical reliability and the like. If, in the Introduction, he stated that he is simply giving an overview of others' ideas (see Beasley-Murray's commentary on John), that would be one thing. However, Durham makes no such claim and the reader is left wondring where the author's religious convictions lie.In all, this is a solid commentary on a difficult and diverse book of the Bible. While there are flaws, the book's merits far outweigh them. I recommend this book.
Summary 4: After thoroughly enjoying Gordon Wenham's commentary on Genesis, also part of the Word Biblical Commentary series, I had great expectations of John Durham's commentary on Exodus. However, I was disappointed. Durham has almost no discussion of the historical background of the story and little on the literary structures within the text. He focuses almost entirely on his translation of the text and, frankly, as a Hebrew reader and speaker I find his translation extremely inelegant.Still, the commentary provides some interesting insights and excellent bibliographic material."
0940745054,California Real Estate Primer,"Summary 1: This book is precise and to the point. The book is very well written, organized very well and has one object in mind - helping you to learn real estate rules and passing the salesman exam.The Real Estate Primer is also an excellant tool for somebody who wants to improve their knowledge of real estate terminology, laws and procedures.After each short chapter you will find questions which can easily be answered or you may choose, as I did, to fill in the answers and then study the question with the proper answer thereby reinforcing your understanding of the chapter.I passed the exam the first time after reading through this book. I have used it many times since for review and to look up specific areas.It is A MUST for anyone taking the sales exam.Jerry Zeldes, CPA
Summary 2: I'm studying this book to pass my broker exam. A friend was using a terribly rated study guide and failed twice. He then studied with this book and passed. It's clear, factual and doesn't include trivial facts or try to be clever.
Summary 3: After 30 years The California Real Estate Primer is still the best. My email address has changed but my comments have not.Jerry Zeldes, CPAp.s. many of my friends have decided to pass the Salesman exam, and most of the texts that they use have hundreds of useless pages and many hours of vague information which only makes the learning process harder.

B000L1A8RS,The Desert Crop,"Summary 1: Cookson has been writing historical fiction for over forty years and I have been reading it for close to thirty. After her death in 1998 her estate released this last book. As always she gives us strong characters with loving ways, drama, death, murder, class struggles, and even a bit of lust and loving along the way.Set in Northeast England we are entertained by the comings and goings of the Stewart family. Patti the rebellious daughter, and Daniel the subservient son, manipulated by a father Hector Stewart who is evil and pathetic. After their mother's death, Hector finds he hasn't the money to run the farm, so is forced to marry an Irish woman with the promise of an inheritance.I love how Cookson is able to take the reader into her world and make you want to return to it. Even after years without one of her books, I find myself drawn to them, like a renewal of something wonderful never to be forgotten. She will be sorely missed. Kelsana 9/24/01
Summary 2: Good historical about an English family in decline due to the tyrannical father's squandering of the wealth. The father, Hector Stewart, marries an rich, or so he thinks, Irish woman.The story deals with the existing children and the new step-mother from Ireland and how they all cope with the abuses of the Hector Stewart.A tragedy frees all of the family to live different lives and find a better future.This is a good historical saga and well worth reading.
Summary 3: Set in Northern England in the late 1800's, widowed farmer Hector Stewart decides to marry Irishwoman Moira Conelly but here's the rub - he thinks she's coming into money and she thinks he's much better off than he truly is. Nor does Moira realize at first she's married a drunken, womanizing wastrel on the edge of running the farm into the ground. Nevertheless, Moira has a secret or two of her own and she does her best to make the best of it, which includes an ever growing brood of children.Hector's debts and drinking continue to drag down the family's livelihood, until a fatal accident changes all their lives - but it forever binds Daniel to the land and Moira's children. Will Daniel ever be able to break free and claim the woman he loves? Does Frances really love him or is she just looking for the best free ride life can hand her? Will Daniel ever wake up and smell the coffee and see the woman who has loved him for years? Inquiring minds want to know....While this isn't the fasted paced, page turning, action packed book you're likely to come across I enjoyed it a great deal and definitely plan on seeking out more from the author - and at about 100 novels she should keep me very busy for quite some time. This is the kind of feel-good comfort book that's perfect for snuggling up with on a rainy day or a wintry afternoon. 4/5 stars.
Summary 4: I totally enjoyed this book. It covers a period of time and shows how people lived in those days. It was very interesting."
1401359299,Leadership Through the Ages: a Collection of Favorite Quotations,"Summary 1: The short introduction by Rudi Giuliani gives weight to the value of this slim book. We become great leaders by reading about the lives of great leaders and examining the thoughts of great leaders. That's why quotes are so great. They capture key thoughts in a way that is elegant and easy to learn from.This book is short. What it lacks in length it attempts to make up for in depth of meaning. The quotes are divided into sections: Character, Courage, Compassion, Wisdom, and Inspiration are just some examples of key themes that these quotes are grouped into.The quotes tend to rely heavily on Emerson, Antoine De Saint-Exupery, Plato, and Theodore Roosevelt. While there's probably a hundred or so great leaders quoted in this book, certain figures have multiple quotes throughout. Most all the quotes are excellent choices, with some surprising individuals quoted.The only reason I give this book a 4 is because, in my humble opinion, the compiler should have devoted some more quotes to Eastern thinkers. With the great contributions in the areas of leadership by thinkers such as Sun Tzu and Musashi, it's a shame that only Confuscious, Gandhi and Lao-Tzu seem to have made it in here. Still, it's clearly a reflection of the strong western background of the compiler.If you're looking for clear and motivational thoughts on leadership, this book is a great find. I highly advise buying it!
Summary 2: Rudolph W. Giuliani will never be forgotten for his display of Leadershipin the streets of New York City after the planes crashed into the Towerson September eleventh, two thousand and one.Though living through the same emotions as the people he was elected to lead,he held his ground, and gathered his teams of first-responders together through thenetwork of Department heads he had put in place.

Summary 3: If you are looking for a not-too-big-yet-not-too-small collection of good leadership-related quotes from a wide variety of authors, then this book is for you.Organized into 19 specific leadership-related sections with each section focused on a specific leadership-related topic (character, courage, compassion, posterity, service, vision, wisdom, power, conviction, action, work, inspiration, change, the oval office, risk, failure, teamwork, challenge, self-knowledge), this 275 quote collection was focused and easy to read. Each page featured no more than five quotes, and contained plenty of open space that allowed me to jot down my thoughts, comments, and observations.The challenge with any collection of quotes is that each collection is limited by the personal preferences of the compiler, and the value of any collection is determined by each individual reader. I was familiar with many of the quotes (from my years of collecting quotes), and enjoyed many of the quotes that were new to me (they will be added to my personal quotes database).This book contains enough good quotes to make it a valuable addition to anyone's leadership-related library, and its length and organization made it a perfect public transportation commute companion.
Summary 4: This is a small but interesting book about the thoughts of various leaders throughout history. It is sold as a companion book to Giuliani's best selling book, Leadership (two volume set). The book is introduced by Rudy Giuliani who has put together a collection of over 250 inspiring leadership quotations from individuals like Lee Iacocca, Will Rogers, Martin Luther King, Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt and many others. Giuliani explains why he compiled these quotations by saying, ""...leadership is mostly a skill that people learn. They learn from their parents, from their friends and colleagues, from their teachers, and from their clergy. But leaders also learn from leaders they've never met - by reading about them"".These quotations are organized in 20 subject chapters and include titles like character, compassion, vision, conviction, action, inspiration, failure and teamwork. Some of these quotations are well known but others are unique. Leadership Through the Ages is intended to provoke serious thought and reflection. Here are a few examples...Example moves the world more than doctrine.- Henry MillerThere are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.- Edith WhartonA leader should not get too far in front of his troops or he will get shot in the ass.- Joseph ClarkLeadership Through the Ages is the kind of book to read when you are sitting by a crackling fire on a cold winter eve. Most of the quotes are short and pithy. If you like to read or ponder quotations, this is a satisfying book you can read in one evening's sitting."
0517222876,The Greatest Cat Stories Ever Told,"Summary 1: Usually when I read cat stories they are true stories of some antics or heroism of the feine species. This book is a collection of fiction stories by famous authors like Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling, Dorothy L. Sayers, Anton Chekov and others. Reading about cats in fiction is a new and interesting experience for me as the felines take on larger than life personalities and roles.Anyone who is a fan of cats and literature will probably enjoy this book. My favorite story was the one by Rudyard Kipling where he writes ""I am the cat who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me."" I beg to differ, I think the food dish takes priority over all other places, at least for my cat that is so. This is good reading. -- Val Lull
Summary 2: Well, y' know, I love these books, and they're full of wonderful stories told by terrific story tellers. They are great short stories to relieve the relatively nauseating, growing ever-more-expensive rides on San Francisco's MUNI busses. At the very least they ""entertain"" this rider in a diversionary alternative to that reality. I recommend them otherwise, as well, especially to soothe the savage beast, ha, ha. Great reads, people!
Summary 3: After starting to read the first of many stories in this book. I closed it and didn't read the rest. I do not like fiction because fiction is a story made up in someone else's head. I thought these would be true stories. So if you like fiction, you will like this book. If you want true cat stories, which I prefer, this is not for you. It's my own fault being disappointed in this book merely because it is fiction. I guess it's a good book, again, if you like fiction."
1413498485,I Might Just Be Right,"Summary 1: Skipping over Meek's few features in ""I Might Just Be Right,"" the question is whether subjects of his newspaper columns have stood the test of time. Some definitely have. His pre-war prediction that the Bush administration was not planning for taking care of the Iraqi War vets was on target. The Veterans Administration last year came up with a ""surprising""shortfall of $1 billion. And as far as his column poking fun at the CIA, to quote former CIA director George Tenant, ""It's a slam dunk.""
Summary 2: Meek seems to be an interesting person. His book of newspaper columns and features is very readable and one you can put down and pick up to choose a subject from the different categories in the index.The book reflects the views of someone who obviously has spent a lot of time dealing with national and international issues. Some of his opinions have proved to be true, some will take time. I'm betting most will. And I especially liked the feature on his friend's long effort to win a gold medal in the Olympics.
Summary 3: A nice collection of editorials and essays written by Meek over a 50-year period from a college editorial in the 50s to current opinions of potential presidential candidates. His humor is biting and his depth of knowledge is impressive. You may not agree with them all but you WILL think about them.
Summary 4: I know the author. He writes cleverly, as he talks. The book is a series of short essays, covering the many years of this man's remarkable career,and discussing a wide range of topics. He discusses with considerable insight his experience with the famous and the infamous in Washington DC, and elsewhere, encountered over a lifetime of being an""insider"" among the politically powerful in the Beltway. Most of the commentaries are fascinating, and many involve the authors experience with persons we have all read about in the national news. The number of prominent people the author has had interactions with is astonishing. It will be interesting to see if his political predictions come true, but his reasoning and the insights behind it leave one thinking...He might just be right! I would certainly recommend his book as a most interesting read."
0451122038,See It and Say It in German,"Summary 1: I too, like the previous reviewer, have never regretted buying this book. I've since moved on to other texts, audio, and so on. But I will always cherish this book for having shepherded me gently into this marvelous, and sometimes perplexing, language.
Summary 2: This book is good for begginers and people who are going to a german speaking country and have only a short time time to learn some german. This book starts you off with some german pronunciation then you start to learn phrases in german and they are shown with pictures to help you remember them. After a few pages you have 10 questions to see what you have learned and if you should move on. You also learn how to conjigate verbs whether they're past, present, reflexive, regular or irregular. There are also glossary's for restaurants and hotels and at the end of the book there is also a german to english glossary. This book does have it's flaws like it doesn't have the informal forms for 'you' they only use the formal forms. If you don't learn du for you singular and ihr for you plural then you won't understand what someone might be saying and you wouldn't know how to conjigate the verbs properly when you want to use informal language.You might also be confused because ihr has other meanings besides you. This book also doesn't use the es-tset which is a letter that isn't in the english alphabet. It looks like a capital B but in it's place they just put 2 ss's which is how you pronounce it but if you come across it somewhere you won't know what it is and it will confuse you. This book also doesn't explain too much about grammar so it leaves you with some questions.So if you want a book to learn some german fast or you just want to see if you might like it then this is the book for you. On the other hand if you want a book that really gets into learning german then you should look elsewhere.
Summary 3: See It and Say It in German is undoubtedly a useful and informative conversation course for beginners that has helped me along in my endeavor to learn the German language. I've worked through this paperback a handful of times and still gladly refer to and use it. It contains a total of 256 pages. Margarita Madrigal and Inge D. Halpert are the authors of this guide--both of them are internationally well-known language instructors. See It and Say It in German was initially released in 1962. When it comes to the contents, there's a pronunciation guide, conversation lessons, a traveler's handy word guide, a grammar section (containing a list of verbs and exercises), an A-Z German-English vocabulary section, and an index. See It and Say It in German contains two learning methods that have been successfully used by thousands of students: the word-and-picture aid and the ready-made vocabulary. The words, phrases, and sentences are shown with drawings that explain their meanings. Ready-made vocabulary provides the learner from the beginning with words and phrases that look and sound like their English equals. As for the conversation lessons, each page includes one lesson. Actually, you don't have to work through the lessons starting from the beginning; you can randomly go to whichever lesson that you want. Other material that is included within the conversation lessons section are exercises to test your progress, everyday expressions, a page on telling time, a page consisting of a list of regular verbs, another list of verbs on two pages, and a composition on Vienna. The traveler's handy word guide contains words that are used in restaurants, hotels, and stores. Also, numbers, family terms, colors, days of the week, months of the year, seasons of the year, and parts of the body are featured. See It and Say It in German is a good, user-friendly paperback that I find to be helpful."
1880654113,The Far Islands and Other Cold Places: Travel Essays of a Victorian Lady,"Summary 1: Elizabeth Taylor, one of those indomitable Victorian women who hiked their skirts and explored where even tough moderns would pause, faced the wilds of northern Canada and of the Faroe Islands. The miserable weather etched the inhabitants but didn't faze our guide.Taylor was neither a sentimentalist nor a cynic but saw clearly and wrote straight. Trained as an artist and enamored of nature--especially birds and flowers--Taylor appreciated people who lived closest to her beloved surroundings. By her account, they responded to her interest by inviting her to share their hard-bitten lives and without pretense, she accepted their invitations.Taylor financed her economic travels by writing for middle class magazines, like Frank Leslie's, and for outdoors magazines where a female byline was a rarity. These essays come from those published pieces and some journals archived in her hometown, Minneapolis. A descendent has assembled the collection, but the task had real literary and cultural value that counts for much more than familial duty.A book about places few of us ever would want to visit became for me a book full of passages worthy of reading to friends. A description of the whale hunt, for example, rings with authority and subdued horror. Elizabeth Taylor emerges as her own modest heroine, and her quiet, gemhard descriptions stay alive long after the book is finished.
Summary 2: Interests in Victorian Age travel was not only confined to Britain but also to Europe in general and North America in particular.The travel essays of a Victorian Lady were begun by Elizabeth Taylor in 1886 and ended with a total of 39 articles. This bookhas many. She wrote for the London Globe, Atlantic Monthly,New York Herald, Fishing Gazette (London), Popular Science Monthly,Forest and Stream plus other magazines.She was enthralled with the northern climates: the people andthe countrysides. Her descriptive essays are priceless to be sure.Upon reading, you wont shiver because of the cold but, rathercome away with warm memories!Dag StombergSt. Andrews, Scotland
Summary 3: This is an excellent book for all of us who are in love with the Faroe Islands and/or Iceland. Elisabeth Taylor has a nice and easy language and one really gets involved in the everyday life that she describes in the book. Recommended to everyone who is interested in understanding the history of Faroe Islands and Iceland as well as some of their traditions."
B000MV8HES,Hard Hat Area,"Summary 1: My son loves this book-- it takes you all around a big building site with Kristin the iron worker apprentice. It has a nice rhythm, and lots of great but simple vocabulary-- like choker cables and spud wrenches.This book is also written on two levels-- you can read the narrative, which is brief and sweet, or you can stop on each page and read the notes. The notes describe what exactly the ""plumber upper"" and the ""deckers"" are doing, and which tools they use.AND- it was written by a woman no less.
Summary 2: Very cute book for kids of all ages. Illustrations are very original, and you can expand your child's knowledge with the definitions given on each page, for example ""a connector is the person who..."" It is not sexist at all. It just happens to be a woman as the apprentice, which I think serves as a great role model. In the back of the book, there is an ""Author's Note"" which says ALL apprentice ironworkers deliver food and equipment to the others. This review comes from a proud Union Ironworker Family!
Summary 3: I am a General Contractor building residential and commercial buildings and this book is an insult. These are ""Kristen's"" ""usual days:"" ""What can I bring you?"" He (it's always a HE) responds:""A cup of coffee and three sugars."" Next page, a man needs ""...connecting bolts and a blueberry muffin. And an egg and cheese sandwich."" Next page: He's ""always hungry...would you bring me a big hot chocolate, three oatmeal cookies, and [oh] a choker cable, too?"" During every single next page, she is asked for ""an orange juice and a cherry danish,"" ""a big iced tea with lemon,"" ""a big shiny apple, ""coffee, cream and sugar and a bag of peanuts,"" ""I'm all set with my spud wrench BUT I'd LOVE A LEMONADE!"" ""Two bags of pretzels and a peppermint...chocolate...jelly doughnut, ETC."" On the last page, then author writes: ""And then they go back to work."" I'm insulted and saddened. Can't find women like me in construction achieving, being role models. This book brings our children back to the 1950's pre-feminist era. Let's work toward equality in the workforce, not undo everything we've fought hard for ... and won.
Summary 4: Thank you. It was just what I wanted. The condition is great and my grandchild will enjoy it very much I'm sure!"
0975533193,The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica,"Summary 1: This is the first book I have ever purchased on Amazon that I had to return. It seemed to have been written by a man, there was not one scene that did not include some type of phallus. I am a fan of Victorian tales and classic from writers like Jane Austin, this book seemed to be written by someone from modern times trying to speak with the syntax and semantics of Victorian times. I would not recommend this collection to anyone who likes sensual and sexual play between women. There were some scenes with incest and rape. I did not get very far in this book, about the first 5 stories, in an attempt to find something worth my time. I returned the book the very next day after receiving it in the mail.Take a look at it in a book store before you purchase it to varify my words.
Summary 2: Surely this book is a joke; a very bad joke. I am quite familiar with Victorian Literature and am quite familiar with so called lesbian tales of sex and I am quite familiar with the differences in the way women and men write each. This was written by a man, have no doubt! The Pseudo Victorian style was probably put together in the late 1960s or 1970s when such books seemed to be all the craze. As has been pointed out, there is the problem of incest and rape involved in some of the stories. This is a normal ""guy thing."" I have no doubt that a local yokel frat boy would love this sort of thing, and to be honest, that is just who it was written for. Do not waste your money on this one, nor your time trying to read it. Neither is worth it. A person could take a copy of The Pearl, switch a few words around, and come up with something better than this...what ever it may be. I do not recommend this one and really rather resent the publisher trying to pass this one off as Victorian Lesbian Literature....it is far from it.
Summary 3: I seriously question the validity of these stories as real Victorian writing. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no background and bibliographic references whatsoever. I would at least expect approximate dates and publishers of the original texts.My guess is that they were written by a man familiar with Victorian erotica, but some time after the era ended. One clue is that one story describes the woman as a ""lesbian,"" a word which didn't come into popular use until well after the Victorian era. Sexologists began using it in 1889, but it is really doubtful that a writer of common porn would be aware of the most recently published scientific writing.On the other hand, the stories are entertaining as some ridiculous little pieces of erotica.
Summary 4: For those readers that love lesbian erotica and want to vicariously experience the naughtiness then this certainly is a great book ....The essence of Victorian erotica has always been 'no holds barred' as far as sexual encounters were concerned and the elements of pursuit, capture and ultimate sweet sumission make them the best of the erotica genre. Also, as in this book, many of the greatest stories were written by that famous author 'Anonymous' ... HMMMMThe first story in this book, 'Caroline', we have our young innocent heroine going off to a girls boarding school with the daughter of a family friend. Although she may have come from a repressed household it certainly didn't take Caroline long to teach haer what she really really liked.The sencond story, 'Susy', probably one of the shortest in the book a young waif of a grl is taken into the household of a wealthy lady of society where we find that expectations of grooming her in the world of sapphic love were not really that necessary.This book has 16 short stories and weighs in at a whopping 590 pages..... and .. because it is an antholgy of great Victorian erotica the reader may find some stories 'interesting' while others are so hot they will cerrainly 'rock your boat' .....
Summary 5: I just bought the book ""The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica"" and ""The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica"" from Amazon. I find there's some question in edition of the two books. As anthologies, the books include many novels, but they do not have bibliography and I can not firnd authors' names of these novels,we even want to know more about these authors' information. Anyway, the books should indicate which novles are full and others are excerpts(we should know the excerpt from which chapter of the original novel ).I have no idea of them. So I am not very satisfactory of the two books."
1930865198,Space: The Free-Market Frontier,"Summary 1: A review of Space the Free Market FrontierAlthough the Cato Institute, the publisher of this book, did not misrepresent its contents, I was expecting something different. I was hoping for more of a ""future of space science"" tome so that I could find out more about the specific space technologies which will ultimately work. (The shuttle program obviously has serious problems). What I found instead was a collection of scholarly essays, mostly centering on the economics of the issue, to be read by congressmen and policy wonks.There is nothing wrong with that, of course. But personally, I would have preferred something more in line with G. Harry Stine's book, Halfway to Anywhere: Achieving America's Destiny in Space, or at least an essay or two picking up where Stine left off in 1996. I'm especially interested in knowing more about the state of the art of single stage to orbit (SSTO) technology. I didn't find much along that line.What I did find, however, and what made the book more than worth the purchase price was a lucid essay by Dennis A. Tito, the American Businessman who paid his own way to fulfil his lifelong dream of going into space. It was a colorful, competent, and descriptive view of what it would be like for a regular person to go into space. Having been rebuffed by NASA, he went to the Russians who cordially welcomed him, trained him for his ""mission,"" and gave him a very expensive vacation aboard the Russian section of the under construction International Space Station (ISS).Tito's experiences and his vision for the future of space exploration were inspirational and uplifting in the wake of the Columbia Shuttle disaster. NASA tried to scuttle Tito's adventure, and that same massive bureaucracy has probably succeeded in scuttling the shuttle program.The solution seems clear to me; we need more free enterprise. Follow the model used in the development of aviation in the 20th century. If you agree with that statement, buy this book.
Summary 2: Compiled and edited by Edward L. Hudgins (Washington Director of The Objectivist Center), Space: The Free-Market Frontier is a straightforward look at the interest private entrepreneurs who have had an increasingly important role in accessing the &quot;final frontier&quot; of outer space. The writings constituting Space: The Free-Market Frontier derive from educated and knowledgeable contributors concerned with the practical issues for creating forms of space transportation, the legalities of private activities in outer space, commerce in outer space, and more. Space: The Free-Market Frontier is an involving, informative, highly recommended look at the intersection of economic and technological possibilities in space exploration for the private sector.
Summary 3: What else to expect from a Cato Institute publication? They support the corporatism of space as the last frontier."
0310227747,"Brief Guide to Ideas, A","Summary 1: You defintely can judge the book by its cover on this book. I really liked it a lot. I used this book as a reference tool to teach my philosophy/ethics class in college. This is defintely not for the serious philosophy student, but a very nice introduction to the ideas that dominated western thought throughout the Greek/Roman world that has come to us today. It also treats postmodernism, and the ideas that dominates today as well. This book presents a very lucid history of ideas that is very enjoyable and fun to read!Because I had to interloan the book from another library and I am unable to renew it, I will buy it after I place this review. ...
Summary 2: This book lost all credibility when I read the authors' attack on fundamentalism. I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is &quot;borders on idolatry,&quot; that fundamentalists are &quot;often parasitic&quot; and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to &quot;other approaches.&quot; Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having &quot;a totally closed world view,&quot; and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was. The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title.
Summary 3: The authors did a superb job of bringing the greatest minds in history seamlessly into one book. If you enjoy the questions of life and the symmetry of psychology, philosophy, theology and more this is a must read. If you are already familiar with Plato, Freud, Marx and the likes it may be to brief for you, but if your new to them it's a must buy."
0873586859,Swimming Lessons,"Summary 1: Great book for kids starting to swim. This book my daughter loved because she also loves water. The pictures are also very bright and colorful.Another great book for kids starting to swim is below.Mommy and Me Go to Swimming LessonsMommy and Me Go to Swimming LessonsMommy and Me Go to Swimming Lessons
Summary 2: ""I didn't say anything then because that has a very good chance of happening, and there isn't really any way out once Uncle Frank gets you, except holding your breath for a really, really long time, which might spoil the day for everyone else, even though the ambulance would come and I would get to ride inside it while they saved my life.""Verbatim quote of the author's writing abilities. I myself had a hard time trying to understand some of these sentences - imagine my first grader's annoyance.Run-on sentences, mixed verb tense, missing punctuation, you name it. The book should be called ""Bad writing lessons."" The editor must have been out sick the day this manuscript was turned in.Give it to a kid you dislike to repulse them away from reading.But the illustrations are nice. So, one star for that.
Summary 3: My daughter Sadie and I love this book. The author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl. This girl, Jane, is smart and funny and spunky. It's a great story!"
B000KYLLT0,You Might Be A Redneck If...,"Summary 1: This Foxworthy gem was first published in 1989 and reprinted in 2004.It reads as good today as when it was first published.That is for the simple reason that being a Redneck is not some passing trend..it's timeless.I think that Jeff foxworthy is one of the best,if not the best,comics and entertainers around today.Some think that the great comics of the past such as Gleason,Red Buttons,Red Skelton.Myron Cohen,just to name a few,are a thing of the past; and there is nobody around today that can compare with them.I have to admit that I tend to agree,but for one exception ;Jeff Foxworthy.There are a lot of standup comics who have been able to put together a show with a bunch of jokes and some great timing with punch lines; but greatness comes when a comic creates a style of his own and there is virtually none like him or can even copy him.That was true of the examples I gave ,and it is true of Foxworthy.Who else could you say was like Gleason,Skelton,Jerry Lewis,Red Buttons?...nobody,and there's nobody like Jeff Foxworthy.One of the greatest skills of a true humorist is to see the humor in everyday people and things that are all around us,and we blandly go through life without observing humor in front of our eyes. Being a Redneck is something that can only exist in North America. They thrive in Canada as well as in the U.S.It is a state of mind that derives from the ability to do things the way one chooses to do them;as opposed to what someone else decides is proper ,convential,acceptable,normal,genteel,correct,or as the Irish would say..""bog-standard"".First and formost ,being a Redneck entails some ,at least, Celtic heritage.That has been culturally developed by centuries of doing your own thing,even if it is directly in conflict with some self appointed establishment.If you don't believe this;then why do you never think of cultural backgrounds of the Jewish,French,Italians,Orientals,Spanish,or any other typecasts when you think of Rednecks? The reason is that it is Celtic territory. And do you know the origin of the term Hillbilly? No,it doesn't have anything to do with HILLiary and BILL Clinton; but from the early Scotch-Irish settlers (Protestant Celtic),who often called their kids Billy or William ,after their hero William of Orange;who settled in the mountains of Tennessee and nearby states.This book is filled with descriptions and drawings of the endless ways to identify a Redneck.I suppose we are all a bit of a Redneck at heart;but Foxworthy is a master at showing what a high level of accomplishment the art of being a Redneck can be taken to---and with pride of accomplishment.How are these for example?YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK IF---""Your mother does not remove the Marlboro from her lips beforetelling the state patrolman to k-- her a--.""""Your father fully executes the ""pull my finger"" trick duringChristmas dinner."" (and blames it on the turkey!!)""Your sister's educational goal is to get out of high school beforeshe gets pregnant.""""You actually know which kind of leaves make the best substitute fortoilet paper.""If you are looking for some real humor,let Foxworthy provide it!!!
Summary 2: Fans of the 'redneck humor' of Jeff Foxworthy as seen on TV comedy shows will be glad to know his one-liner observations about what makes a 'redneck' translate well to text and one-panel comics, too. David Boyd's illustrations grace a funny book perfect for the non-reader fully aware of all-too-real 'redneck habits'.
Summary 3: Yep... if the directions to your house include ""turn off the paved road"" this is the book for you. As a person who has lived off the paved part of the road (and perhaps I've been out of NYC too long) but I recognize the people in this book. There's humor here because of the incredible sense of recognition. I've known people like this and I adore Jeff Foxworthy for pointing out the humor in these comical stereotypes!"
B000NWJ90M,Portrait of The Artist as a Young Dog,"Summary 1: This memoir is painful, beautiful, rugged. He shows himself to be proud, horrid, loving, sentimental. It is a small collection of short, powerful stories that span from childhood to young adulthood. He refers to himself at times in first person, other times in third (so you have to pay attention!). Growing into manhood, observing others and being observed. He expresses experiences of personal pride and humiliation with equal relish. Portraits of others in his life are humorous, admiring and at times sad. Hanging out with odd-balls; learning about women. It may have been a simpler time for technology, but the emotional struggles, the economic realities, the physical exertion required in a life in early 20th century Wales were harsh. All-in-all, this book is unforgettable.
Summary 2: I would rather read this book than any by James Joyce. Thomas may be remembered for his wonderful poems, but his short pieces are, under no circumstances, to be ignored.Thomas writes of his youth, which is a subject that many writers have attempted to write about, and where they fall short he excells. The stories are nothing but fun. Actually, they are more than fun; they are often beautiful. By all means, READ THIS!
Summary 3: Hemingway once said that ""all good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you; the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse.""PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG DOG is one of those happy few books..beautifully written,funny, moving, cruel and joyful at the same time..please read it!!"
0919985181,Quick Success Stained Glass- Instruction,"Summary 1: This is the first book I bought when I started learning this amazing craft. It has beautiful illustrations and pictures (in color), which really show some of the techniques better than you can describe them. It is short and to-the-point, but I did eventually buy a more detailed book. But this one remains the one that I check back with to answer quick questions! Definitely worth the money!
Summary 2: I am a beginner and I'm teaching myself. This book was very helpful in teaching me how to begin. It also has a lot of nice designs that I was not afraid to try. I found this book very helpful in getting started.
Summary 3: I am a stained glass artist. This is an excellent reference book. I have given this book to some of my students. Very informative, lots of color pictures, easy to read and understand. Also includes a number of patterns from beginner to more advanced. This book is No. 1, in my opinion, of all the instructional stained glass reference books I have owned.
Summary 4: A wonderful, simple to use booklet for the novice. Also a very good book for a refresher for those who have done stained glass projects before. A very nice inclusion of usable patterns, color choices, degree of difficulty for each project and the square footage of glass needed to complete the project. I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering a hobby in stained glass.
Summary 5: I tried stained glass construction 25+ years ago. I wish I'd had this book then. I'm starting over again. I'm going to the GlassExpo in Las Vegas the end of Mrch 06."
0671750445,Grammar for Smart People,"Summary 1: Though this book is on grammar, it is not that hard. It tries to make the subject simple, fun, and the most important thing, easy to remember.You'll need to make a review of some grammar, but the book is self-contained to that purpose, and it gives you all necessary tools for the work. These tools will help you to understand how to write and speak better English, and if they were not enough for you, every &quot;rule&quot; has examples and these examples, in turn, are explained when needed.The book recognizes English is a changing language, so there are exceptions for some rules, but it shows you the most general exceptions and helps you to decide which road you should take.Nonnative English speakers, beware: The book has &quot;fun parts&quot; that could be difficult to understand. If you are not an intermediate or advanced speaker of English, better look for another book.For Spanish speakers:este es un buen libro para practicar y aprender gram&aacute;tica inglesa, pero est&aacute; orientado a hablantes nativos del idioma, no a estudiantes. Si no est&aacute;n en un nivel avanzado, otro libro puede ser mejor.
Summary 2: This book took the confusion out of High School English class. Everyone who uses the written English language should invest in this book. It's easy to understand and fun to read.
Summary 3: As an English teacher who has worked with community college, adult education, high school, and international students, I recommend this thin, practical book.In less than 200 pages, Grammar for Smart People introduces and reviews the essential grammar points that we should know and sometimes forget. ESL students will also find it clear, direct, and useful. This thin book also contains more real information than many far more expensive, thick, and mandated college textbooks. It's far superior and cheaper than the vastly over-rated Betty Azar series for English language learners or the many other drill and kill textbooks imposed on too many vocational education and community college students.If you want an affordable, portable, and practical grammar guide, buy this Grammar for Smart People.
Summary 4: I was hoping that the title meant: ""Advanced grammar and its more arcane forms""What it truly meant was: ""Normal grammar text with a supercilious and pompous title""My father was always strict about grammar as I grew up, and rather growing a dislike for it, I fell in love with words and word play. I became the type of person who would argue the merits of the Oxford Comma and wonder about bound root morphemes with friends. I fantasize about owning my own copy of the OED. I wanted a book to review the more difficult and erudite aspects of English grammar. The title intrigued me, but failed to live up to my expectations. This is a fairly rudimentary treatment of grammar. I've seen better, and I've seen worse. Not a purchase I regret, but do not expect anything beyond the standard grammar text that attempts to be interesting.
Summary 5: I love this book! I taught grammar and composition on the college level, and my students paid over $80 for a textbook. Had I known about this book, I'd have had them use it; and I could have supplemented instruction. It's a wonderful resource, right next to the thesaurus and dictionary. I know all that information is available on line, but sometimes it's just not worth the search time when the book is right at hand."

What a resource: It lists so many parks that I didn't know allowed dogs, plus lots of hikes for great views of the Pacific. We're looking forward to going to the dog-friendly stores listed for Beverly Hills and taking the ferry to Catalina Island.Our dog adooooores this book! She's no longer cooped up at home.
Summary 2: Love this book! It is always in the car and always helpful. Nice write-ups about the different parks and places to walk. If you like to run around with your dog do buy one of these and leave it in the car.
Summary 3: I am glad I got this book. Lots of good ideas and things to do with the Dog. Only reason it does not have five stars is that I wish the book was more detailed with hiking trails and more places to eat with the Dog
Summary 4: Look, you got a dog or two? Living or traveling in southern California? Then you need this book! Seriously, to find out which beaches, parks, restaurants, hotels, etc. will accept your pooch in LA or OC, this is it. Lots of little-known dog-friendly places and tips on travel make this book worth its price."
0867165987,The Bible Made Easy: A Book-by-book Introduction,"Summary 1: This book takes each book of the Bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written. The author puts all the information in very understandable words. It does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place. It is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the Bible. It is more of a reference book than an ""easy read.""It is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others. Good for RCIA groups.Donna Murphy
Summary 2: It would be hard to make introducing the characters, plots and themes any easier. This is the best single book I have found in a short, concise and easily readable volume. Fr. Schehr's book could easily be used by any Protestant student just as Catholics often use work of Protestant scholars. This book is appropriate for beginners and long time readers ready to much more seriously explore salvation history. This is another good book for those who believe as does Pope Benedict XVI that there is a knowable truth: Jesus.
Summary 3: Fr. Schehr opens this outstanding resource with an explanation of the origins of the Bible, the differences between the Catholic Bible and others, and the connection between teachings of the Bible and the Church. He also provides a helpful framework in the form of five ""major markers"" representing times of freedom or deliverance for God's people.The material on each book of the Bible follows a clear format, as shown in the following example taken from the Psalms section. In the introduction we learn that St. Ambrose called the Psalter ""a gymnasium of the soul"" to indicate its wealth of inspiration to strengthen our faith lives. Schehr expands on that topic briefly, then discusses different types of psalms and describes the layout of the Psalter, adding a chart to summarize. He suggests effective approaches for reading the Psalter. The section closes with a list of spiritual lessons from the Psalms: (1) praying the Psalms gives us strength for the spiritual journey, (2) any human emotion can be the starting point for reaching out to God, and (3) the whole range of life is an occasion to offer praise to God. In addition, the treatment of Psalms and all other books includes ""On the Clock,"" an invaluable tool for keeping track. A prominent clock icon is accompanied by keywords and approximate dates for the events in the book and other historical occasions. In Psalms, this quick aid tells us that David lived around 1000 BC, and the Jewish people were returned from exile around 500 BC.
Summary 4: A quick and easy way to get to know the Bible. Now to go through and study what I found interesting. Can find the real story now and not just passed on legends.
Summary 5: There was a delay in receiving this book--I blame it on the holiday mail. The used book came in ok condition; however,in the explanation before purchase it stated there might be ""some underlining"". In fact, there was major highlighting throughout the pages. It would have been nice to know that."
1591130956,Caleb's Daughter,"Summary 1: It is not very often you find a book that combines the history of the Jewish people with a story of tender love, for family and for God. This is such a book. The story is of a young Israelite girl named Achsah, who is the only daughter of a high leader of the tribe of Judah, Caleb.We are told at the beginning of the story some of the traditions of the Jewish people, such as the Father always chooses a husband for his daughter, this does not set well with young Achsah.Achsah is a strong willed girl, not wanting to be told whom she will spend the rest of her life with, as is the custom. The author takes you into the heart of young Achsah as she battles with her emotions of loyalty to her father, her God and the traditions of their faith. Will she be able to submit to these traditions and still find the happiness she believes belongs to her? You become entwined in her mind as she comes to terms with her destiny. It is a tender story, carefully written with respect for the history it is based on, yet full of adventure and drama. A taste of the past flavored with emotions felt in the present, very good mix.Unveiling during the conquest of Canaan, the work allows you to experience the victories and defeats of these chosen people, taste a little of their rebellion and understand a great deal of their faith, as young Achsah blooms into a woman and takes her place in the land of promise.A very good read! Thumbs up on this one!
Summary 2: The Bible tells us that ""Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? Who answered, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs."" (Joshua 15:116-19)This is all we know of Caleb's daughter. But in the long and recently re-popularized tradition of Midrash, Kay Flowers has taken it upon herself to tell the rest of the story. Her novel begins in the days before the Hebrews entered the Promised Land, and it spans many years until the death of Othniel, judge of Israel. The book focuses on Caleb's daughter Achsah, a headstrong young woman who finds herself the center of a romantic conflict.The work has several good descriptions, and it is certainly more true to the spirit of the Bible than, say, a novel like The Red Tent. Flowers fills in the empty spaces in the biblical narrative without insisting on contradicting its central teachings. The narrative method of the author, however, is at times didactic, and there is on the whole too much telling and not enough showing. Consequently, the book is occasionally uninteresting. The work, however, does address important themes, such as romantic vs. mature love and personal vs. communal/traditional faith.
Summary 3: Books like THE RED TENT have sparked an interest in works based in Biblical settings that focus on women rather than their famous male leaders. Kay Flowers has chosen to focus her novella on the years just before and those that followed the entry of the Children of Israel into their land of milk and honey. Her protagonist, Achsah, is the only daughter of Caleb, one of Moses's greatest generals.The child of Caleb's middle age, Achsah is not surprisingly more than a little spoiled. Throughout many of her early years, she is determined to have her own way, by manipulation and stealth when direct means fail-those direct means usually entailing a tantrum of one degree or another.As time and life take their toll, however, Achsah comes not just to maturity but to a deep faith in the god of Israel, a faith that sustains her when tragedy and danger impinge.Although clearly the work of a talented storyteller and likely to appeal greatly to younger readers, the unfortunate brevity of Ms. Flowers's work leaves the reader, especially one who has an interest in the historical and cultural background, feeling unsatisfied. One closes the book with the sense it was meant more as a morality tale than an historical one, a lesson in the importance of faith and in caring for others. The plot evolves as a series of episodes in Achsah's life, beginning with her as a young child and ending with her in the twilight years. Once she has had her moment of epiphany, what follows is little more than a denouement that goes on too long.The author's attempt to justify the slaughter of innocents-according to the messages delivered from God via Moses and Joshua, the Israelites were to exterminate everyone living in their ""promised land""-also lacks force. No matter how perverse the Canaanites' religious and social practices may have been, the killing of children simply doesn't quite fit with the concept of an all-loving god, and one senses the author wrestling with that issue, unable to avoid it yet unable to adequately deal with it, either.Nevertheless, CALEB'S DAUGHTER is an excellent choice for young readers both for its nicely drawn details of the Israelite culture and the subtle lesson it contains. Christian parents looking for first-class reading material for their older middle-schoolers and younger teens will find it an excellent addition to their libraries."
0803214804,"Boarding School Seasons: American Indian Families, 1900-1940 (North American Indian Prose Award)","Summary 1: I picked up this book for my college class on the study of Native Americans from Civil War to present. Even though this is an educational biography on boarding school life, it is actually quite intriguing. Brenda Child completely covers the topic with very interesting material. I won't say that Boarding School Seasons is one of my favorites, but if you are interested in the topic of Indian boarding schools, then you will actually be suprised at how easy it is for this book to keep your attention. If you are viewing this book for a college course, then your class shouldn't be too hard. This is one of the few college required texts that I actually managed to enjoy
Summary 2: Interesting research including the voices of the students and their parents. I especially enjoyed reading their letters. The pain of parents separated from their children was palpable. It was, however, somewhat repetitive.
Summary 3: Another book with stories about the trauma that the Boarding Schools caused our Indian People of Turtle Island. Many of us are products of the Historical Trauma that our ancestors endured at the hands of the White Man!"
0910735638,The Art of Sufi Healing,"Summary 1: I have never seen a book quite like this, although I have come across self-help books or instructional guides which try to help with some simple guidelines. This book on the other hand gives complete and numerous examples and practical methods to achieve the goals given (Note: the section on working with the AIDS Patients.) As if all the other books were afraid to open up..........or perhaps they just didn't have much to say. This wonderful guide lets it rain down.....and when it rains, it pours.
Summary 2: When I read this book, I was so at peace with how easy is it to become healthy and happy!!! With this book, those who feel asthough they are always in duress, can see that they don't have to be! I have given this book to many of my friends, most of whomhave never practiced Sufism, or even heard about it, and they seemed to have loved it. Also the recipe for the soup is GREAT!!! I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be healthy and happy, and move on from their past!
Summary 3: This book contains a sound, practical, and holistic approach to healing through Sufi methods.As I understand it , the main premise of this approach is that the body heals itself. To look at it this from a spiritual angle, the soul, whose physical manifestation is the body, is the all-knowing intelligent manager and healer, and if we stop interfering with it through our thoughts, habits, and mal-nutrition, it will preserve the balance that is a pre-requisite to healthy living and the main healing factor for existing complications.There is ample information relating to concentration and energy balancing techniques, physical exercises, and health boosting nutrition."
0521829070,The Quantum Quark,"Summary 1: The Quantum Quark by Andrew WatsonIn the preface, Watson explains his book ""...focuses on quantum chromodynamics, the essentials of how it works and how it came into being."" He goes on to say ""At the modest cost of a complete story...The Quantum Quark explores QCD in more detail than all other books on particle physics intended for a wider readership."" And finally assures the reader, ""...this is a pleasant stroll through great ideas, and not a textbook."" I agree on all accounts.Let me qualify to whom I think this book will attract.Some of us are deeply curious, intelligent & interested folks - actively seeking answers and doggedly pursuing the richness of fundamental physics at a readership that spans a range well past the ""golly-gee!"" pop-physics level (e.g. Hawking/Green) but striving, reaching, stretching on tip-toes below the University academic level with its rigorous mathematical quantification proofs and rules. While it is meant for a serious lay-reader and undeniably non-mathematical in its presentation, this is definitely not light reading. People who aren't afraid of becoming a little lost while navigating the figurative `forest through the trees' can have courage this book will guide them if they're patient and willing to be led. To be sure, the dedicated reader will aquire a nodding acquaintance with concepts of conservation laws, symmetries, gauge theory, and U(1) X SU(2) & SU(3) group theories (which ultimately account for and lie at the root of the most fundamental physical laws) and last, but not least, a good conceptual grip of QCD. A willingness to do some re-reading will bode you well. The trip can be somewhat heavy going with its deep, abstract and technical description of a fundamentally mathematical subject - but it is well worth the wear & tear on the intellectual soles of your mind. Ultimately, this is an account of humanity's pinnacle intellectual achievement.OK, so what have we got here?TABLE OF CONTENTS1 Introduction 12 Symmetry 93 The quantum world 194 Toward QCD 1105 The one number of QCD 2696 The gregarious gluon 2887 Quarks and hadrons 3058 Quarks under the microscope 3289 Much ado about nothing 37010 Checkerboard QCD 391Appendix 1 A QCD chronology 413Appendix 2 Greek alphabet & SI prefixes 426The introduction does its job setting the scope of subjects: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the Electro-Weak force, and last, but principally, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) a.k.a. the theory of the Strong Force. It brushes on experiments in high-energy physics that bring the constituents of the Standard Model to light.After the introduction, we're treated to a little history of the mathematicians and physicists who brought us Group Theory and a sketch of the properties of groups (i.e. identity element, closure, associativity & the inverse element). Descriptions and brief examples are given for O(2) orthogonal and SO(2) special orthogonal (abelian) transformations plus mention of associated dimensional 2x2 matrices; non-abelian SO(3) groups are discussed and the U(1)XSU(2) and SU(3) groups are revealed to be the fundamental abstract spaces of particle physics in a nutshell. Lie groups are briefly mentioned as well.The next major section, ""The Quantum World"", is my favorite material in this book. It starts with the fact that the measured magnetic moment anomaly of QED demonstrates its superior standing as the crown achievement of theoretical & experimental physics. Basic quantum mechanics topics are effectively covered:Energy quanta (Planck's constant h), wave phase & interference, Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger, the principle of least action and Feynman's sum over paths.The elements quickly evolve in relative complexity and abstraction - ultimately leading towards a clearly developed connection between QED to QCD. The progression takes us through:mass-energy relations in Relativity, matter-antimatter pair production, Fermion and Boson spin & statistics and Pauli's Exclusion principle, quantum fields, the four-momentum, virtual particles, vacuum polarization, Green's functions, Feynman diagrams, vertex interactions, self-energy, infinite divergences, perturbation and renormalization program (dimensional regularization), effective low-energy field theory, Fermi's theory of weak interactions to Weinberg/Glashow/Salam and Veltman/t'Hooft Nobel prize winning contributions in the electroweak realm, and finally the all important gauge principle including the example of changes in potentials and changes in global vs. local phase.I'm now going to do the author a grave disservice by reviewing the remainder of the book in an all too brief summarization. The majority of the book plumbs the depths of QCD. Andrew brings us by the experimental facilities for a thorough inspection of the accelerators & detectors (BNL RHIC, Fermilab CDF, CERN-LEP, DESY, KEK-BELLE & SLAC). He gives complete coverage of the physicists responsible for its development and associated milestones. To name just a few of the many discussed in great detail: Yukawa - Isospin, mesons; Yang-Mills - CP violation, Gell-Man - the Eightfold Way; `the particle zoo', families, Quark-Gluon, flavordynamics, inelastic scattering, color charges; Nambu - spontaneous symmetry breaking; the Higgs mechanism & weak neutral currents; Gross, Wilczek & Politzer - Asymptotic Freedom.Watson judiciously included countless diagrams to illustrate important concepts and fundamental interactions plus many photographic pictures of physicists, experimental devices and facilities. The back of the book includes a good glossary and a nice annotated ""Further reading"" section that breaks suggested titles in easy reading, not-so-easy reading, and `hard core' sections.That's it. Altogether a serious undertaking - I hope you are challenged by it and thoroughly enjoy it as much as I have!p.s. I recommend these complementary books: ""Deep Down Things"" by Schumm; ""The Force of Symmetry"" by Icke; ""Fearful Symmetry"" by Zee; ""Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe"" by Lederman; and ""Out of This World"" by Webb. N.B. check out the reviews on these books, also browse the ""So You'd Like To..."" and ""Listmania!"" lists below to help decide which ones you might want to consider.
Summary 2: The Quantum Quark is a close look at quantum chromodynamics that does not require an extensive mathematics or physics background of the reader. Freelance science journalist and regular contributor to ""Science"" magazine Andrew Watson explores such topics as the quantum world, ""the gregarious gluon"", quarks and hadrons, the true significance of the vacuum state, and much more. A handful of black-and-white diagrams and photographs illustrate this fascinating tour of scientific theory, recommended for anyone with even the most casual interest in understanding the fundamental particles composing the Universe.
Summary 3: Not a casual read but for a person like myself, a graduate in Physics in 1969, it represents the most concise, complete and readable history of particle Physics as it stands today. It is an incredible piece of work. The appendix alone is a work of art.
Summary 4: I can scarcely add to the outstanding reviews already here! Just to say, if you're into quark physics, or just plain ol' particle physics, you need to get this book. Every page is packed with fascinating stuff you can't get anywhere else in the popular press.This book gets real technical in many places. If you're a complete physics newbie, I might suggest you improve your general knowledge of quantum physics first. Also, a good place to start with quark physics isQuarks: The Stuff of Matterby Harald Fritzsch. This book is now nearly thirty years old, but he lays out the fundamentals so cleanly that you will be better equipped to take on Dr. Watson's volume.Lastly, I must say that Watson's assertion that ""The QCD Casimir force is real"" is something I've not seen published anywhere else. I have suspected this to be true for a long time, but it is gratifying to see it asserted in print by someone else. I mean, if all four fundamental forces are really different manifestations of one overarching grand-unified field, and if there is an electromagnetic Casimir force, then necessarily the Casimir effect should also be present in the other three forces. Makes sense to me, at least.'Nuff said. Get the book."
B0007IKVGI,On heroes and hero-worship and the heroic in history (The World's classics),"Summary 1: Carlyle holds a special fondness for heroes or Great Men in his heart. Heroes are of such import that ""Universal History.... is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."" He refers to them variously as ""leaders of men, these great ones, the modelers, patterns, and in a wide sense creators of whatsoever the general mass of men contrived to do or to attain."" Carlyle's Great Men, in addition to their palpable leadership traits, further possess an innate quality that acts like universal lightning rods, attracting the admiration of their lessers. This quality is ""the light which enlightens,"" one that has a direct connection to God: ""He is the living light-fountain, which is good and pleasant to be near...a natural luminary shining by the gift of Heaven."" The Divine Hero is but one of six heroes in history, the other five being the Hero as Prophet, as Poet, as Priest, as Man of Letters, and as King. Simply to walk freely in their presence is a boon of incalculable worth: ""Could we but see them well, we should get some glimpse into the very marrow of the world's history.""Religion is the key to understanding a man's character. Carlyle does not limit religion to the conventional sense of adherence to any one creed. Instead, he labels religion as a marker of the connection of one's ""vital relations to this mysterious Universe."" These relations are a function of his duty and destiny therein. When Carlyle asks a man concerning his religion, certain questions arise: Is that religion Heathenism? Is it Christianity? Or perhaps it is a mixture of Paganism and Skepticism? These are not nitpicking queries since their answers give the questioner the soul of the man or of the nation.Carlyle turns his attention to Odin as the first example of a hero. Carlyle has difficulty understanding why his contemporaries misused the term Paganism when referring to Odin. He does suggest that these contemporaries may have confused traditional Paganism with quackery, priest craft, and dupery, all three of which do not permit one to acknowledge that Paganism in its purest form was no more or less than a tried and true means for a primitive culture to realistically account for the complexities of the world around it.A second way for moderns to view Odin in the context of his times is to perceive him through the prism of allegory. Carlyle notes that allegory has traditionally been the province of poets and folklorists and as such finds it unlikely that any man in any age could have seriously entertained the belief that the centrality of a culture-organizing mythos might be a mere sporting convention. Further, Carlyle objects to allegory as an explanation for the ongoing vitality of Paganism on the ground that allegory must follow a pre-existing faith. Thus, the pagan belief in Odin must have preceded any attempt to explain it as overt allegory.Carlyle mentions the allegory of the cave from Plato to explain how one who has been brought up in the ignorant darkness of a cave might react to the sudden appearance of a hitherto unknown sun. Such an emerging cave dweller might view the sun or nature itself as the magical province of the gods. We, suggests Carlyle, are much like that cave dweller--there is simply too much for anyone to absorb without resort to magic as a ready explanation. We manage to grasp part of the Mysteries of the Universe not by virtue of our superior insight but by avoiding the use of that insight in the first place. It is only when we resort to insight that we assign words as abstract symbols that purport to explain the origin and nature of objects but truly do little more than cloud the indecipherable essence of those objects with words that pretend to explain them. The result is that we congratulate ourselves on our godlike wisdom when we are in fact appallingly ignorant. By ""words"" Carlyle means science itself, which ""has done much for us; but it is a poor science that would hide from us the great deep sacred infinitude of Nescience, whither we can never penetrate on which all science swims as a mere superficial film.""As an example of an inexplicable and unknowable aspect of nature is Time, which Carlyle apostrophizes as having the ability to engage in ""rolling, rushing on, swift, silent, like an all-embracing ocean-tide on which we and all the Universe swim like exhalations."" Carlyle sees Time as a miracle, one which will forever be beyond the ken of man. As if the macro-world of nature as exemplified by Time were not sufficiently daunting to us, Carlyle uses the micro-world image of the humble leaf to act as a similar roadblock to human understanding. What is it then, in both Time and the leaf, that suffuses them with the life force sufficient for animation, he asks rhetorically. The answer is quite simply, God. When we can acknowledge that God is the source of all things material and immaterial, then we can readily admit that there are those selected individuals who can see this divine source more easily than can others. And it is precisely here that Carlyle links his theory of the Divine Spark to the Great Leader who can sense it. Even in pagan days, there were gifted individuals who were finely attuned to this spark which connected mortal man to immortal gods: ""To these primeval men, all things and everything they saw exist beside them were an emblem of the Godlike of some God."" As man perceives the wonders of nature, he realizes that he is an integral part of that nature and as such: ""We are the miracle of miracles--the great inscrutable mystery of God."" From this, Carlyle reasons that to worship nature in this manner is but a precedent step in worshipping the human hero who moves in that nature: ""I consider Hero-worship to be the grand modifying element in that ancient system of thought.""The admiration that Carlyle sees as the obligation for all to have for the Hero he soon qualifies into the necessity for ""heartfelt prostrate admiration, submission, burning, boundless."" Such traits are kin to loyalty which Carlyle insists is the unquestioned right of all Great Leaders to expect from their followers. Carlyle uses the financial metaphor of bank notes to suggest that true Great Heroes are like bank notes, fully backed by gold bullion. It is the fake, the fraud, the interloper who introduces counterfeit notes into circulation. Such false heroes can emerge only in cultures wherein true heroes are unlikely to emerge--as in democracies. Where civilizations of past eras have crumbled into dust it is because they lacked heroes as a buttress against the debilitating influences that drove Diogenes Teufelsdrockh to wander endlessly. Great men can arise in any age in any culture but there is no assurance that they will infinitely do so. Thus, when these Great Men do arise in moments of crisis, all men must honor, respect, and obey them. To worship them is, of course, the next logical step.In Carlyle's books preceding Of Heroes, he introduces various strands of thought that culminate in his vision of an all-powerful Great Leader who leads by virtue of a divine spark that is immediately sensed by his subordinates. These qualities include one who recognizes the value and need to work, has the ability to defer immediate gratification of basic needs like happiness, can remorselessly dispense with the rudiments of civilized discourse, and has an abiding loathing for democracy and the common man.The images and tropes that Carlyle uses reinforce his notion of the semi-divinity of his Great Leader Heroes. When he discusses them, his choice of diction tends toward the glowing and the positive. ""A Great Leader,"" he asserts, ""is the living light fountain...a natural luminary shining by the gift of Heaven."" His choice of Odin as an exemplar of the Pagan Hero is telling in that Odin was the king of the Norse pantheon. The Hero is such because of the Divine Spark that inheres within. Carlyle can scarce mention this Hero without adding an immediate list of qualifiers that redound to his glory: noble, admirable, godlike, sacred, all the while eliciting a concomitant list for his followers: submissive, obedient, loyal, and dutiful. When it comes to mentioning non-Heroes, Carlyle uses contrary terms: quackery, priest-craft, dupery, and the like.Carlyle makes no pretense at objectivity. For his theory of the interaction between Great Leaders and historical continuity to work, he must relentlessly image these heroes as subcategories of that history. If history truly is the biography of Great Men, then it follows that it is they who make the times rather than the other way around. To Carlyle, each culture worthy of the name had a Great Hero at the base, organizing, rallying, plotting, or otherwise ensuring the survival of that culture: ""In all epochs of the world's history, we shall find the Great Man to have been the indispensable savior of his epoch."" Even in his day, there were many who objected to elevating to near godhood those whose primary claim to fame was an ability to project the right image at the right time and in the right place. Carlyle called all such Great Leaders or Heroes. A century later, we have quite different names for them.
Summary 2: I am on an intellectual quest to understand what makes a man a hero and a woman a heroine.Thomas Carlyle did an amazing amount of research and is the first book in a long seriesthat I will read on mythological heroes/heroines and actual heroes/heroines in history.I am interested in how mythological heroes/heroines carried on through the ages and how they influencedactual heroes/heroines throughout history.I was lucky enough to come across this book on archive.org and was able to downloadit and read it for free.The prose of this century is sometimes convoluted which causes you to spend more timetrying to understand and then reflect on the author's words.The book was, as I said, the first read of many to come on an intellectual quest tounderstand the whole 'hero/heroine' concept.I am glad I came across this book. This book piqued my interest more on the whole mythology ofheroism.
Summary 3: 19th Century Social Thought is given in terms of heroes.Thinkers like Carlyle are really rare.Book is composed of his lectures about Paganism, Islam, Shakspeare, Puritanism etc. in 1840."
1563111535,Alae Supra Canalem: Wings Over the Canal,"Summary 1: It seems odd that the major campaigns of World War II which were fought in the Americas should be neglected by historians, but this is certainly the case. Laudably, in recent years somewhat more attention has been paid to the war in Alaska and the Aleutians, but both the defense of the Panama Canal and the intense antisubmarine campaign in the Caribbean are still little-known. Mr. Hagedorn's book goes a long way toward filling this vacuum. Particularly striking is the case he makes for the &quot;useless&quot; Douglas B-18, &quot;the bomber the Air Corps bought when it should have bought the B-17,&quot; to paraphrase popular sentiment. In fact the B-18 met the Air Corps specification for which it was designed, and gave yeoman service in a role for which it wasn't: antisubmarine warfare. Its crews dealt with such physical hazards as the fickle Caribbean and Central American weather (without weather radar) and a tropical climate (without air conditioning), and the keenly felt frustration of a low priority for personnel, equipment and supplies. Mr. Hagedorn's account of how they overcame these obstacles and prevailed makes for an absorbing read. I recommend this book highly.
Summary 2: Military historians are notorious for being poor writers; they seem to have a quota on the amount of howevers, moreovers and indeeds they must put into a book. This reference sets the bar, I scanned the book to my computer and did a count of the historians use of the words however, moreover and indeed; 322 howevers, 297 moreovers, and 244 indeeds.The writer had one more extremely annoying habit, for some reason he loves to use the phrase ""none other than."" For example the pilot was none other than the squadron commander; or the passenger was none other than the president.The book is very difficult to read because of the writers frequent use of writer's crutches. If the reader can ignore that, this book is still quite interesting.
Summary 3: An excellent summary of a subject that has had virtually no public coverage. Book is mostly hard data, serial numbers, and subject-specific facts, with no padding and no waffle. Outstanding! (Review by an old coot with 55 years warbird involvement).
Summary 4: I purchased this book with great expectations. It is richly illustrated with rare photographs of obsolete aircraft soldiering on in an important area of operations. The writing and research was excellent, which I have come to expect from Mr. Hagedorn. However, one of these rare photographs depicted a nude strip-club dancer. Others depicted aircraft with explicit 'nose art'. When I read a military history book, it is my expectation that I (or my son) will not be subjected to objectionable photos. I returned the book for a refund. Sorry Dan."
0738813141,Life Is a Circus,"Summary 1: I really enjoyed &quot;Life is a Circus&quot; by Shirley Carroll O'Connor. It is a warm humorous love story and a first hand insight into what it was like being part of circus life in a bygone era. Shirley writes about of being a newly wed on a Circus train, learning the ropes and class system of Circus life, living on the road and about the friends the bride made among the performers and side show acts. What better training for a woman who later became one of Hollywood's top Press Agents than sharing your life (and car) with wild and dangerous animals. O'Connor's perspectives and insights into the Circus culture can be appreciated by circus fans or anyone who likes a good autobiographical story. Her idea of a bad day was when she (literally) lost a heard of elephants in downtown Hollywood. I found myself smiling and laughing my way through this book. Buy, borrow, or check this book out of the library, it is a great read.
Summary 2: &quot;Life is a Circus&quot; was one of the most refreshing true stories that I have ever read! It took me back in time to my first visit to the circus and years later when I took my children to the BIG TOP! I can hardly wait to take my grandchildren.Who ever wrote the inside cover of this delightful book was 100% right in stating, &quot;When you turn the last page of &quot;Life is a Circus&quot;, you will feel as if you have laughed and shared memories with a &quot;new best friend&quot; My only complaint was I read the book in an evening and wanted to read more!
Summary 3: Shirley O'Connor's first book,&quot;Life is a Circus&quot; is undeniably a three-ring circus of her charmingly warm and humorous experiences with the &quot;Greatest show on Earth&quot;. Most of us only dream of running away to join the circus,Ms. O'Connor had the circus practically run away to join her! She shares with us her amusing trials and insights in living side by side with the circus community: the clowns,the side show artists,the aerialists and trapeze performers and,with myriad laughter,the animals. Ms. O'Connor's delightfully true story of herself as a young bride sharing her honeymoon with a leopard nervously roaming the back seat of the bride and groom's jalopy will leave you wondering what other outragous adventures lie ahead for these newlyweds;she doesn't let us down! With her circus experiences Ms. O'Connor gained some of the valuable lessons that brought her to a future as a pioneer in a then untried field of women in commercial public relations. One has to marvel at the approaches she must have used during that neoteric time. Every enjoyable page of &quot;Life is a circus&quot; is filled with a delicious freshness of 'feel good' experiences that will leave you wishing that you,too could run away with the circus,no matter what age you may be. So grab a bag of peanuts and snag a front row seat in your own private Big Top with Shirley O'Connor's &quot;Life is a circus&quot;.

1844151387,Red Star Under the Baltic: A Soviet Submariner's Personal Account 1941-1945,"Summary 1: The vast majority of ink spilled on WWII submarines has centered upon German U-boats and the Allied effort to defeat them. The reason is understandable: the German U-Boat campaign offers readers an impressive array of engagements, personalities, and technological advances; its geographic scope was substantial, blanketing the Atlantic Ocean from its icy northern reaches to its balmy southern climes, and around Africa's horn into the Indian Ocean; and many of its commanders and crewmen have made themselves available for interviews, commentary, and have written about their experiences.Unfortunately, history's laser-like focus on German U-boats has made it more difficult for studies on other aspects of WWII submarine warfare (including the role American submarines in the Pacific played in defeating imperial Japan) to receive the publicity and readership they deserve. A particularly heavy shroud has covered Soviet submarine operations from 1939-1945, and the fact that this small navy helped Britain and the United States defeat Nazi Germany. Hopefully, Korzh's ""Red Star under the Baltic"" will buck this unfortunate and undeserved trend.By training a mechanical engineer, Korzh served as the chief engineer on three different Soviet boats on and under the Baltic Sea. His account graphically details life and death on what many have called ""a German lake."" Indeed, the Baltic was an exceedingly treacherous place for enemy submarines. A quick glance a map of this region will show you why this was so. Navigationally, the long and narrow island-strewn Baltic was a complicated body of water to operate in, and its shallow depth made hiding from hunting warships doubly difficult (and in many cases, fatally impossible). When the Germans captured the Soviet bases in the central sea region early in the war, the Soviet Baltic Fleet retreated northeast to Kronstadt and Leningrad. The Kriegsmarine did its best to bottle these submarines up in the narrow reaches of the Gulf of Finland, and blanketed the narrow entrance with a nearly impenetrable anti-submarine defensive network of tens of thousands of mines, anti-submarine nets, shore-based artillery, surface warships, and air cover.""Red Star"" was written in the early 1960s, when the events portrayed were still reasonably fresh in the author's mind, and originally published in Russian in 1966 under the title ""Reserve of Strength."" Presented in the first person, Korzh's superb record details the abysmal life and death conditions Soviet sailors endured on their primitive but stoutly constructed boats.As readers will quickly discover, Korzh was one lucky sailor. His first patrol in early 1942 was aboard S-7, which returned safely only to be torpedoed by a Finnish submarine on its next patrol. The entire crew was lost except for those fortunate enough to have been on the bridge when disaster struck. Korzh, however, was not aboard because he had been transferred to another boat, S-12. His extensive second patrol sank two freighters and returned safely after suffering heavy depth charging and a very narrow escape. S-12 was lost with its entire crew the following year, but the lucky Korzh had again been posted to third boat, jumping again off the devil's shovel. His third patrol in March 1945 was aboard L-21, a large mine-laying submarine. The patrol was exceedingly successful and accounted for three warships and a tanker.""Red Star"" will interest everyone who enjoys reading about WWII naval matters in general, and U-boats in particular. Authentic Russian accounts of naval service are very rare, and memoirs in a frontline submarine exceedingly so. Everyone familiar with Das Boot and life aboard German U-boats will appreciate and see obvious similarities between that account and Korzh's recollections: hardship, terror, comradeship, and death. German accounts of life aboard a U-boat in 1944 and 1945, when simply going to sea was the equivalent of a death sentence, are rare because so few crewmen from that period managed to survive. It was under similar conditions that Korzh and his comrades operated from 1942 onward in the dangerous waters of the Baltic. Viktor Korzh died in St Petersburg in 1993. ""Red Star under the Baltic"" is his legacy. Thankfully, it is now available in English. I highly recommend it.
Summary 2: Although this book was first published in Russia some 40 years ago, this the first English translation. Written by a distinguished former Soviet submariner, it is a moving, vivid and first-hand account of life in the submarine service of the USSR during the bleak years of WW2. The author died in 1993.Greatly feared by the Germans, I found it fascinating to learn how they employed extensive counter-measures to ensure the entire Soviet Fleet was kept bottled up. In this way German U-Boats were then able to strike at allied and even neutral shipping with impunity. Then we learn how, in 1943, all that began to change as the Allies learned how to strike back at their, hitherto unseen, enemy.For those with an interest in the war at sea, it is very easy to become so preoccupied with U-Boats and the North Atlantic campaign that the struggles undergone by our Soviet Allies (as they were at that time) are completely overlooked. The involvement of Finnish Forces on the side of Germany (Finland eventually withdrew from the War in 1944) was an additional threat of which I previously knew very little.Altogether a fascinating, well written and worthwhile book which, for me at least, has opened up a whole new area of interest in the war at sea during 1939-1945.NM
Summary 3: When it comes to submarine warfare in World War II, the majority of the books out there deal with the American and German efforts. There are a few British and Japanese ones as well, but very few on the Russian side (I only know of one other besides this one). Thus, it was nice to find this book which details three separate patrols by a Russian submariner against the Germans. One of the best things about this book is the translation--it was originally written in Russian, but the translation was so good it was hard to tell the book wasn't originally written in English.The book gives a vivid description of life about a Russian submarine and its many hazards, not all of them caused by the enemy. Sailing in such an unforgiving area as the Baltic Sea presented many problems for Russian subs, and at times it seemed as if the author experienced them all. The book also provides a glimpse into life in Leningrad during the early parts of the Nazi siege as that's where the author was stationed. One of the more interesting aspects of the book is the role of the Communist Party political officers on the subs. They act as a second captain in some ways and at times I felt as if they're more in charge of the boat than the actual captain.The book could have used some maps to give the reader a better understanding of where the author went on his patrols, so bone up on your Russian and Finnish geography. Overall, a good read about an area of World War II which has received very little ink.
Summary 4: Execelent account of service in Baltic Fleet submarines during WW II. The author was a dedicated communist citizen who at least on the surface mirrored all the Soviet propaganda about the joys of Communist life. As an example he notices one day while on patrol that it is the second anniversary of Latvia joining the USSR and an occasion for celebration. In reality, after Joseph Stalin signed a secret treaty with Adolph Hitler, that allowed Germany to attack Poland without fear of any Soviet interference, the USSR then moved into Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and forcibly incorporated them into the Soviet Union - not much occasion for celebration on the part of the Latvians at all. Nevertheless, the details of life and operations in several Baltic Fleet submarines are fascinating to this former U.S. submarine officer.
Summary 5: The vast majority of books on WWII submarines focus on German U-boats and Battle of the Atlantic. ""Red Star under the Baltic: A Firsthand Account of Life on board a Soviet Submarine in World War 2,"" by Viktor Korzh offers a completely fresh examination into a virtually unknown aspect of WWII submarine warfare: life inside a soviet combat boat.""Red Star"" was written in the early 1960s, when the events portrayed were still reasonably fresh in the author's mind, and published in Russian in 1966 under the title ""Reserve of Strength."" Korzh was the chief engineer on three Soviet boats operating on the exceedingly treacherous Baltic Sea. The narrow and shallow body of water was a deathtrap for submarines. Korzh's superb memoir details the abysmal life and death conditions Soviet sailors endured on their primitive but stoutly constructed boats. Some of the events Korzh was exceedingly lucky. Two boats he left were each sunk on their next patrol. ""Red Star"" will interest everyone who enjoys reading about WWII naval matters in general, and U-boats in particular.Authentic Russian accounts of naval service are very rare, and memoirs in a frontline submarine exceedingly so. Everyone familiar with ""Das Boot"" and life aboard German U-boats will appreciate and see obvious similarities between that account and Korzh's recollections: hardship, terror, comradeship, and death. Korzh died in St Petersburg in 1993. ""Red Star under the Baltic: A Firsthand Account of Life on board a Soviet Submarine in World War 2,"" by Viktor Korzh.

159558028X,Oil: A Concise Guide to the Most Important Product on Earth,"Summary 1: I agree with Tanya. I found that this book offers a lot of useful information, but of which is effectively hidden from the American public. But the book would have been much more effective had it not be so editorialized and had it allowed the reader to ""decide for themselves"" what they think about the oil industry.I can somewhat forgive the author for the conclusion that the hydrogen fuel cells offer a lot of potential, given that the book was written in 2004. However, given the sizable barriers that the author cites and the fact that plug-in electric cars were not mentioned at all, I wanted to see some real data to support this case. Such data was nonexistent.All told, I don't think this is the best primer on the industry regardless of your political stance. I found ""The Rough Guide to the Energy Crisis"" much more fact-driven, though broader in scope. There are a number of other books on the topic and I encourage you to look elsewhere before reading this book.
Summary 2: I'm specifically writing my first Amazon book review because I just finished this book and it annoyed me so much. I think the topic is incredibly relevant and interesting, but Yeoman basically seems to regurgitate many other books and articles. He says himself that the history chapter is largely pulled from ""The Prize"" (Daniel Yergin). I know that Yergin's book is not quite light reading, but it does much more justice to the complex social and political history of oil. John Ghadvizian's (sp?) recent book ""Untapped"" is also much better, especially to understand more about Africa.Then, moving from rehashing, Yeoman goes into editorializing for the second half of the book, in a way that seems just as thoughtless, only more cliched. The book is clearly anti-W, and I definitely don't disagree with the effect that administration has had on our global reputation and energy policy (domestic and international), but he beats us over the head with his opinion instead of presenting the data for itself. Last, he preaches hydrogen as a saving promise. I believe that we'll need a diverse set of options to wean our current dependence on oil for transportation, and fuel cells may have a place in that, but he seems to just fall into the hype. [...]Last, for some reason it just annoys me that he re-titled the book a couple years after the first print (it was originally called ""Oil: Anatomy of an Industry""). Yes, this may now be called the ""concise guide"", but it does a disservice to anyone who really wants to understand this critical element of our society better.
Summary 3: If you hated the George W. Bush administration and believe that CO2 emissions are rapidly accelerating us towards an apocalyptic fate, then you'll probably like this book. Yeomans takes opportunity to malign the former president and various members of his administration. There is not a single footnote in the entire book, and the chapter on ""Exploration or Exploitation?"" is terribly one-sided. The sourcing notes at the end of the book list the Village Voice, the Center for Social and Economic Rights, Rainforest Action Network, and Global Witness as the primary sources of information for describing Texaco's involvement in Ecuador. No lack of objectivity there. While the scientific community does generally accept CO2-based global warming scenarios, the extent of CO2's effect is still subject to debate (water vapor accounts for most of the ""greenhouse effect""). The fact is, the environmental organizations Yeomans is so friendly with have just as much of an agenda as the automotive and petroleum industries do. Without an environmental crisis, they become irrelevant. I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) only because it was relatively well-written and probably could find use as ""informative literature"" for dissemination by the environmental rights movement.
Summary 4: The preface to ""Oil"" describes the author's thought experiment of what it would be like to go a day without petroleum products. Naturally there would no fuel or lubricants, for cars or any other type of machinery -- but there would also be no plastics (oops, there goes the computer and telephone). There would be no reading glasses or contact lenses. Most of the medicines in his cabinet would be gone. No shampoo, shaving cream or deodorant, and no curtain around his shower. No toothpaste ... or toothbrush. No non-stick cookware, oven-proof glassware or plastic dishes. No waterproof clothing or shoes (unless they have leather soles).There would be no heat in the winter. No harvesting of crops without machinery, fertilizers or pesticides. Credit and debit cards, being plastic of course, are gone. CDs and DVDs disappear, as well anything to play them on, because there are no electronic circuit boards.Very quickly you realize why Yeomans calls oil ""the most important product on earth"" -- it has not only fueled the Industrial Revolution, it *IS* the Industrial Revolution. Without oil, the world very quickly plunges into a wood, iron and stone economy not seen since the Middle Ages.In Chapter 1 Yeomans gives ""a short history of oil,"" from its discovery as a fuel to the mechanization of its extraction and refinement. How World War I was made more lethal (over 16 million dead!) through tanks and troop carriers. How the Allied powers divided up the oil-producing regions after the war in order to protect their own newfound dependence on the stuff.One of Yeomans' great talents is revealing the hidden oil-related motives in history. Pearl Harbor was Japan's bid to control Indochinese oil fields. Hitler's expansion was to ensure energy resources. Who has oil, and who controls its production, has truly shaped the 20th Century.Chapter 2 describes the automobile culture that arose out of cheap gas, with interstate highways, a mobile workforce, and sprawling suburbs. Detroit and the oil giants encouraged excess, and American consumers love their inefficient chrome land yachts.Chapter 3 describes the machinations that have caused (and are still causing) regime change and political turmoil as oil companies set foreign policy and install businessmen to run the lucrative franchises known as ""other nations.""The 4th chapter introduces the concept of ""peak oil"" and discusses the economics of the end of high-grade light crude in easily-drilled areas.Chapter 5, entitled ""Energy Wars,"" describes the inevitable results of the major developed and developing nations competing for the rapidly dwindling reserves.The last three chapters are less timeless, written in 2003-4 and describing the now-familiar Bush Administration policies and mistakes. But they're still extremely clear-headed, factual, concise and irrefutable, and together with the rest of the book paint a very solemn portrait of the legacy we're leaving our children.A legacy of unsustainable growth built on an artificially-discounted, temporarily-available, non-renewable resource. When it's gone how much of our civilization will survive -- and at what cost?
Summary 5: Over the course of my life I've had limited exposure to knowledge about oil - I see gas prices daily, I occasionally pay attention to news stories that feature oil prominently, and I read the protest banners that exclaim ""no blood for oil"" (which I always found to be a rather silly slogan). End all be all, I didn't know Jack about oil until I read this book.The book starts with a history of oil discovery (Chapter 1). Usually such histories are incredibly boring in my opinion, but Yeomans does a great job keeping the reader interested (partially by moving pretty quickly, rather than dwelling on arcane and ultimately irrelevant historical analysis). Chapters 2-7 deal with different policy topics that are predominantly oil oriented: cars in America, human rights and environmental issues in oil exploration, oil prices and scarcity, oil wars, President Bush's association with the oil industry, and CAFE (a piece of emissions standards legislation). The book then ends (Chapter 8) with a brief discussion of hydrogen as an emerging alternative and an afterward on the rising importance of China. From what I know of oil discussions in general, these chapters introduce most of the important elements of the general discussion of oil; reading this book made me feel prepared to discuss oil issues to a moderate degree of depth.For readers who are already familiar with these discussions about oil, I don't know that reading this book will tell you much more than you already know. Yeomans clearly has a liberal bias on the issue, but he is not quite a doomsayer. For those who do not know much about the politics and cultural aspects of oil, I highly reccomend this book as a short read that will get you up to speed so whenever the topic comes up in conversation or news you can have an informed opinion."
0486401758,Magic Garden Fairies Stained Glass Coloring Book (Dover Stained Glass Coloring Book),"Summary 1: While not as beautiful as the Japanese Geishas coloring book, this book is still a worthy purchase for those who like to color. The pictures are quite lovely and the transparent paper offers a multitude of possibilities. There are 16 plates.
Summary 2: I'm an adult who still likes to color, and this book is wonderful! If you like fantasy at all, you will love this book, too. The pictures are beautiful and nicely detailed. I did mine using markers (thin, thick and metallic). I'm going to have to order a 2nd book, to use my colored pencils on! Enjoy coloring!
Summary 3: I'm a 21 year-old college student in Texas. I've always loved coloring books and my father found this one for me. I have had hours of fun making these beautiful pictures come to life. I highly reccomend this coloring book for all ages. No matter how old you are, if you still love to color, get this book!
Summary 4: 16 pages of beautiful, black and white illustrations on quality parchment paper. These are the coloring books I turn to when Im ready for something different to color. Personally speaking, I find these to be the most fun, and a great change of pace, because I can use almost any medium for terrific results, in far less time. I prefer using my Tombow markers with water applied, so I get that traslucent watercolor effect, then come back with either more felt marker, and or a soft colored pencil, and crayola crayons, hit it with a hot iron to melt the wax's into the paper for retaining bold yet translucent colors.( I like the buckling effect this also gives) Lot's of fun to color!! Great projects for kids and adults alike. These designs are also great for crafters.
Summary 5: At first I was disappointed with my purchase, but after speaking with the seller, I have reprized my opinion of the business. The book slipped past his quality control, and he is making ammends to me. I get to keep the book I purchased, although not what I hoped for it will suffice and get a percentage off my next purchace. Thank you for being so custumer orientedRackham Fairy Tale Stained Glass Coloring Book (Dover Coloring Book)"
B000K2956I,"Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal Power Tools","Summary 1: I've read and reviewed the three previous books in Jay Beale's Open Source Security Series -- Snort 2.1, Nessus Network Auditing, and Ethereal Packet Sniffing. I liked all three of those books, and I'm glad to say that this fourth book -- Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal Power Tools (NSAEPT), is a worthy continuation of Jay's series. NSAEPT is a unique resource for anyone who wants to extend Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal. The book could save programmers hours of work, and it should be the first step for those looking to contribute to the development of all three projects.It's unfortunate that an uninformed three star review has been the only commentary on NSAEPT until now. Of course the book is not for beginners! Why write another introductory book, when the three earlier titles serve that role (and more)? NSAEPT is strong precisely because it starts where the other three books end.I learned quite a bit reading NSAEPT. For example, Part I shared advice on using Nessus to audit hosts directly, by examining Windows registry keys, package databases, or Windows PE files (.exe, .dll) directly. I appreciated the discussion of creating NASL checks that were more protocol-aware (for MySQL) or that could speak NTLM authentication to IIS Web servers. Ch 6 even gave tips on building NASL generators.Part II, covering Snort, gave better advice on writing Snort rules than what was found in the earlier Snort 2.1 book. I thought this part was the weakest of the three, however. I would have liked to have seen many more examples of using advanced Snort rule options. Table 8.10 should have said that the + flag means ""match on the specified flags, and allow any other flags."" Also, I thought the author miscommunicated the purpose of the stream4 preprocessor when he mentioned dropping UDP and ICMP traffic. That's an issue when running inline, not passively as most people use Snort.I really liked Part III, which examined Ethereal. Ch 11 offered great guidance on reverse engineering an unknown trace format, namely iptrace from AIX 3. Ch 12 mentioned an undocumented tethereal flag (-G) that was new to me. I enjoyed learning about tap modules in Ch 13, and I did not know that Ethereal uses the wiretap library to read traces -- not libpcap.I subtracted one star from my review for a few reasons. First, NSAEPT features some really annoying formatting problems in many of the code listings. Every place the characters ""FI"" (any case) appear, they are changed into a single nonsensical character. I stopped counting the number of times this happened. For example, where one should read ""Filename"", we see instead ""Xlename"". The same seems to have happened with ""FL""; e.g., ""Flags"" becomes ""Xags"". The reference to libpcap and ""Chapter 1"" on p 159 should instead point to Ch 11. I thought the inclusion of material from Brian Wotring's Host Integrity Monitoring book as Appendix A was unnecessary. Brian's book is great, but I don't think readers need 30 pages from another title. Is that just padding?Format-wise, NSAEPT features smaller fonts than one sees in more recent Syngress books. I thought the font was a little small, but in some ways an improvement over the jumbo text seen elsewhere. I also thought the paper used to print NSAEPT was much better than other titles. Compare NSAEPT with another 440 page Syngress book, Securing IM and P2P Applications for the Enterprise, and you'll see the latter book is much thicker.Overall I recommend NSAEPT to anyone who wishes to do more with Nessus, Snort, or Ethereal. NSAEPT is definitely a book for power users and developers. It's great to see a new book that starts with original material and avoids rehashing what's already been written.
Summary 2: Although this is a good book with valuable information, I think it is a bit vague and short. A good idea is to get 3 different books on their respective topics. Nessus and snort have nothing to do with eachother and snort is more powerful than Ethereal. Its work buying if you have the money and has some decent tips and tricks.
Summary 3: Very in-depth, however, not for someone who is just starting out on Snort, Nessus, or Ethereal. New to Snort, Nessus, or Ethereal - Buy something else. Expert on Snort, Nessus, or Ethereal already? - good book."
B000MV8HFC,Reading the Wild,"Summary 1: This slim book is only 31 pages long; but don't let its appearance fool you: Reading The Wild packs in details on reading the signs of animal life and will require good reading skills from grades 4-6. Doolittle's beautiful full-page illustrations lend to nature facts organized by animal type and revealing the animal's habits and habitat.
Summary 2: It could be said that an Artist sees where others only look..That certainly applies to Bev Doolittle and her work.I have deep interests in Nature,Art,Puzzles,Native Peoples,and all aspects of the Outdoors and the combination of all these things. I was ""stopped in my tracks"" the first time I saw the inspiring work of this magnificient Artist.While I have many books on these subjects in my personal library of over 7000 books;there are none that can compare with the Art of Doolittle in combining all these things in her Paintings.Many times ,all at the same time.This short book, of only 32 pages, does an excellent job of showing the greatness of her Art and explaining what she and her Art is all about. It would be easy to pass this book off as something just for young readers;which it certainly is.However;that would be to sell it short. This book ,just as well introduces her Art to adults,both those who are new to appreciating the wonders of nature and the inspiration conveyed thtough art;as it is to those who have already acquired a love and appreciation for it all.What you will find in this book is a brief sampling of her art which can be found in her other books;particularly ""The Art of Bev Doolittle"" and ""Bev Doolittle New Magic"" .The latter ,I wrote a Review of on November 5,2003.Just like in the real world of nature ,there is always much more to see and experience when one knows what to look for and how to look for it .Bev's paintings are likewise ,much more than what immediately comes to the viewer. Take the Painting on the cover of this book for instance..It is titled ""Wolf"".It is much more than just a paw print in the snow.""Seeing"" rather than a simple ""look"" or ""glnce"",results in the head of a wolf appearing...and a little more study,exposes the complete body of this wonderful creature of nature. Bev's Art has a lot of ""hidden"" images within it,just as does nature in real life,if one only takes the time to see.Elsie Maclay adds a lot to Bev's Art by explaining how to go about ""seeing"" that which is often missed and not experienced.If you have ever sat quietly in the woods,and finally noticed that animal,a deer,a snake,an owl,a raccoon,or even an insect, that has been deathly still watching you,come into view;you'll appreciate what I mean and begin to understand what Bev's Art is all about.If Bev's Art is new to you;a search of the net under her name will produce excellent examples of her Art.
Summary 3: This book is a great tool to use to assist in having a different perspective. We tend to only see what we prceive as being there and looking at nature and how she hides our brothers and sisters is amazing. This type of books are needed in schools, in any teaching environment to assist children who are visual to let others know thier strengths and to assist those who depend on auditory and kinestetic to become more visual."
0954412117,Soldier of the Queen,"Summary 1: After reading Archibald's 'Whales for the Wizard' I had to read more of his work. 'Soldier of the Queen' is the first of a trilogy concerning Drew Selkirk, a young farmer from the Scottish Borders who joins the army to escape trouble and ends up fighting in the Boer War.Bloody battles mix with an intriguing romantic life, and Selkirk experiences life as an irregular cavalryman during teh siege of Kimberley before returning to the infantry at the battle of Paardeberg, where the Canadians were also involved.I recommend this book thoroughly.
Summary 2: I must admit that I had never heard of the Boer War before I read this book. Now I know quite a lot - and have been attracted by Archibald's method of mingling history with fiction to form a truly exciting story.Will there be a follow up?
Summary 3: Until I read Malcolm Archibald's prize winning 'Whales for the Wizard', I had not heard of him as an author. Now I cannot get enough of his books. 'Soldier of the Queen' is a mixture of solid fact and absorbing fiction that had me gripping the edge of my seat. I followed the adventures of young Drew Selkirk in the Royal Borderers (was that a real regiment? I'm not sure) and hope that there will be a sequel.Will Selkirk fall in love with the enigmatic Georgina? I hope so!"
1564961834,Ten Houses: Peter Forbes and Associates,"Summary 1: This is perhaps the best value in pictorial architecture books. For under $20., this book has great photos, straightforeward text, clearly reproduced drawings (including construction details!!), all superbly graphically designed. Even if the architecture doesn't appeal to you, the overall presentation of it in this book will. If you do like the architecture (which I think is a beautiful modern adaption of conventional New England vernacular), then this book is a must-have. You won't find this quality in books two or three times the cost!!
Summary 2: The careful photographs compliment the equally fine details in the buildings of this excellent architect. After a year, I'm still looking at it often.
Summary 3: This is a terrific book with terrific material to present. It is part of a wonderful series. The organization, text, photos, and drawings are all excellent. More authors/publishers should learn to present architecture this well. It's a book I study often for inspiration as Forbes' work is very elegant and spare: qualities more architects should aspire to incorporate into their work, rather than the stylistic faddish gestures all too common today. This is a favorite book in my library."
B000MZ0HZ6,AVAILABLE LIGHT : A NOVEL,"Summary 1: Characters in this book are nice, for the most part, but neurotic. They engage in zany and ill-conceived attempts to fix relationships and repair psychic damage incurred in traumatic childhood incidents. The narrative is humorous, desperate and tragic at the same time. The plot reminds me of tall tales and yarns with an Irish twist -- the very real and believable mixed with you-can't-expect-me-to-believe-this events. I enjoyed it thoroughly! Passages describing sibling and mother-daughter conversations are hilarious and irritating -- just like the real thing.
Summary 2: I liked this book well enough when I read it; as other reviews said, it's sort of silly and fun. But two months after reading it, it's left absolutely no impression.
Summary 3: When I first read this book, I felt that the characters were too strange and the plot(s) unbelievable. But after I had finished it, I kept thinking about the book and the characters -- it was as if they wouldn't leave my mind! I eventually bought a copy and I have since re-read it several times. If you like offbeat fiction and unusual characters, you'll love this. I found the romance of Kitty and Rambeau to be the most &quot;real&quot; part of the book, and very touching."
1880549085,How to Play Black Gospel: For Beginners,"Summary 1: I just started reading this book a few days ago, but I all ready feel as though I'm on my way to becoming a pro at playing gospel music. Robert makes learning simple and easy without all the lingo that can sometimes deter an aging mind. I hope to purchase volume 2 in the future!
Summary 2: This book was a real find for someone who wants to learn how to play the piano and black gospel at the same time. It is very basic and easy to use.
Summary 3: Author has a good teaching style and the book is written in laid back informal English so you don't get a headache from reading dry music theory. And if you can't read music don't worry because you will learn that along the way in this book.
Summary 4: Returned it. New Kindle. Could not get past screen to rate book to even open it to look at it!!!!! Also wanted me to link it to social networks. I don't have anyy. Grrrrrr.... so returned it. Have a new Kindle Touch. Would re-purchase it if someone can tell me how to get past all of that. Will purchase paper copy, I guess."
1555913245,Gardens of Use & Delight: Uniting the Practical and Beautiful in an Integrated Landscape,"Summary 1: It would be hard to overpraise this exceptional book. Written by two people who are master practitioners of our grandparents' ways of living as well as master gardeners, this book is a gem!It is at once a book on gardening (flowers, herbs, fruits & vegetables) and independent living, a book of recipes and remedies, and an arresting narrative of thirty years of work creating a self-sufficient life (and all manner of wonderful gardens) on the bare bones of an old, abandoned farm on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. It is also a book of considerable visual beauty, being generously illustrated in vibrant watercolors by Champlain Valley artist Elayne Sears.I found Gardens of Use and Delight not only meaningful and enjoyable reading, but also a very useful reference for many aspects of flower, herb, fruit and vegetable gardening, and for all manner of things ""homemade."" The recipes in the chapters, ""The Kitchen Garden,"" ""The Contained Garden,"" and ""An Old-Fashioned Fruit Garden"" are mouth-watering gems often rescued from the cookbooks of yesteryear (the Herb Salt and Apple Ginger recipes to name two favorites!) And the wisdom and humanity distilled from the lives of these two people who decided to truly live their beliefs is instructive and inspiring.Perhaps more importantly, though, the book is a reminder of the elements of a rich and healthy life that have been forgotten, if not lost, in these times.I recommend it highly!
Summary 2: I bought this because I love Nova Scotia and homesteading (and own land there where I hope to live). This book is one couple's experience trying to live on a remote farm on Cape Breton Island. It has some good information, but is less about homesteading than about growing flowers.The most detailed information was on the different flowers they grew - lots about the many species and cultivars they tried. There is a section with some recipes. There is a bit about how and why they came to homestead. There is some writing about landscape design philosophy. But the thing that holds the book together is flowers.The title invokes both the practical and the aesthetic, but compared to other homesteading books, this one is really about the delight of growing flowers in a challenging maritime climate.
Summary 3: Jigs Gardner and his wife Jo Ann went off to farm and teach troubled boys in northern Vermont. Next they moved with their four small children to an abandoned farm on Cape Breton Island and lived there for thirty years. With no motor vehicle, they plowed and moved the hay wagon with draft horses. On the thin, poor soil they raised livestock for meat, they grew vegetables and herbs, and everywhere they grew flowers. Their life on Cape Breton is the thread running through this splendid book; but, subtitled, Uniting the Practical and Beautiful in an Integrated Landscape, it is mostly a thoughtful guide to productive farming while living in harmony with one's natural surroundings.Simply reading the table of contents is a treat:Part One: The Whole, Chapter One - The Farm Today, Chapter Two - The Evolving LandscapePart Two: The GardensPart Three: The Integrated Landscape - Practice & PhilosophyThe Gardners are intelligent, well educated, write superbly and, for thirty years supported their family with no institutions to mediate between them and the wolf at the door - remarkable bona fides. For decades they have contributed to small farming journals and literary magazines around the United States. Jo Ann began growing herbs and selling them at Nova Scotia fairs. As her expertise grew, she published Living with Herbs and other well-written and useful books still in print.And Gardens..., besides a pleasure to read, is filled with useful information for and guides about growing. The lovely illustrations by Elayne Sears are far better suited to this book than photographs would be, just as my best bird field guides use drawings, not photos.
Summary 4: This is a good tale, but the couple uses many invasive plants which are NOT to be introduced into our landscape as they take over native plants and leave our pollinators without food sources.
Summary 5: This is a fascinating book full of practical information on growing and using what you grow. The illustrations are beautiful. I'm very happy with this book."
1560974656,Hysteria in Remission,"Summary 1: Robert Williams' comix are amazing. Very violent & vulgar, but amazingly executed. I prefer his black & white comic work over his oil paintings any day. Unforntunately his comic output is pretty small. Nonetheless the several comics presented here are amazing. Extremely detailed and bizarre and they ooze with a feeling of being high.My personal favorite tale is ""Mentor in the Mentor Jar"". Insane ideas such as 'Gorilla Women of the Third Reich', Atrillo Trilobite and the fate of 'Mr. Baldpubis' puts Robt. Williams in a class all of his own.Years ago I went and bought all the individual ZAP comics when i learned Mr. Williams did comic work. These issues are great for you can see the work of the other underground greats, but Hysteria in Remission presents Williams' work in a lovely LARGE format (even at the size, the detail boogles my grey matter) and on beautiful glossy paper rather than fading pulpy newsprint grade paper.Get this book for the insane-ness, the fantastic execution in india ink and completeness of Williams' comic work (early days all the way up to model sheets for an animated series, Jack Clum, Dream interpreter done in 2001.a great piece of work from Fantagraphics - THANK YOU.Now i need to save up some cash to purchase MALICIOUS RESPLENDENCE....

Summary 3: Robert Williams is one of the few bright lights in today's art world. Combining a staggering imagination with a powerful illustrative style, his works provoke and antagonize the viewer like no others, and demand scrutiny.This book shows the evolution of this mad genius by taking us through all of his cartoons, comics, and illustrations, (no paintings) from his first commercial drawings to recent times. It is very interesting to see these after becoming familiar with his oil paintings. The quality of the various items within varies widely, from very crude, to masterly.Some of his comics are extremely smuttty and raw, much more than most of his paintings even. But if you have a sick sense of humor, you'll appreciate them. If you're not familiar with his work, I'd recommend ""Views From a Tortured Libido"" or ""Malicious Resplendence"" as your first Robert Williams book.
Summary 4: If you like (or are a fan of) Robert Williams, or under ground comics, this is an amazing book. Buy it!
Summary 5: Every cartoony thing the man has done... Early through Zap and into the 90's. No more need be said. (his commentary is worth the price."
1420854291,A Paratrooper's Panoramic View: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's 'Rhine Jump' with the 17th Airborne Division,"Summary 1: Paratrooper Robert L. Wilson lived the experiences in this book. It tells of a pivotal operation during World War II that abruptly ended German-Nazi domination of the European continent. Historically, Operation Varsity was overshadowed by Patton's push across Germany. Wilson and his co-author son give full credit to those courageous ground troops commanded by Patton and Montgomery, but the focus of this book is on the lesser known paratroop action.In December 1942, Robert L. Wilson joined the Army. At that time, Parachute troops were a fledgling group. When approached to join this elite group. Wilson agreed. The training was rigorous, but young Wilson fully ascribed to the Parachutist's creed, which said in part:""I realize that a parachutist is not merely a soldier who arrives by parachute to fight, but is an elite shocktrooper and that his country expects him to march farther and faster, to fight harder, to be more self-reliant, and to soldier better than any other soldier.""In March 1945, the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battallion joined several other Paratroop divisions in an unprecedented airborne drop into Germany. No enemy force since Napoleon had effectively crossed the Rhine River but Operation Varsity changed that. The paratroopers had been told to expect a 50% casualty rate because the Germans knew they were coming. That day, 17,122 paratroopers landed en masse to do battle with the Germans for control of their territory.Paratroopers and planes faced heavy artillery flak, anti aircraft cannons, and small arms fire. On the ground, under grueling artillery fire, the 464th swiftly assembled Howitzers airdropped with them. They were the first airborne artillery unit to fire a Howitzer east of the Rhine, and surely earned their place in history that day. Meter by meter the Paratroopers and their Howitzers blasted a path through the Germans dug in along the battle's perimeter. Man to man and hand to hand, for one full day then two, paratroopers who survived hacked their way through the German lines. The paratroopers had been advised to take no prisoners, but hesitated to kill first hundreds, then thousands of surrendering German troops. Instead, they utilized German prisoners to pull cannons and dig foxholes. This continued until all fighting ceased and thousands of Nazi soldiers lay face down at their feet in a posture of surrender.Robert L. Wilson's first hand report of his training stateside and in France, culminating with the Rhineland battle, is a fascinating story. This is a precious history of unsung American heroes from an aging generation of warriors. What truly magnificent men these were! I highly recommend A Paratrooper's Panoramic View to mature readers of all ages.
Summary 2: I wanted to read this book to learn more about Operation Varsity (larger than D-day and in the daylight)in part because my father jumped with the 507 PIR, and there are not many books out about Varsity or the 17 th Airborne, at least not compared to D-Day. I found the book to be excellent regarding background and organizational information, to the point that I may send it to my Dad. It is particularly informative as it pulls information on Paratroopers from many sources, some of which I had already read, an excellent job in that regard. The reservation on this book is that there is relatively little information on what happens past two days after the jump.
Summary 3: `A Paratrooper's Panoramic View' by Robert L. Wilson and Philip K. WilsonSubtitled: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's Rhine Jump with the 17th Airborne Division. P/back 229 pages.This is a fairly unique, if slight, account from a veteran of an under-recorded unit in an often glossed over battle. Robert is a veteran of the jump with an artillery battalion of the 13th Airborne Div, which is attached to the 17th division for this operation. Philip is his son.There is a lot about the training of an airborne trooper. The author, a young and fit farm boy quite enjoyed this. Fleshing out his recollections are also reproductions of lots of posters, cartoons and pages from manuals about the training process. So in terms of primary source material, this book is quite useful. There are also many quotes from other memoirs and histories - all these being well referenced. But too much is expressed in terms of `we' and `us' as opposed to `I' and `me', so it read more like a general history at times than a personal account. I was also thrown when the author revealed he became the company cook but he also trained as part of a gun crew and he performed this role for several days in battle.Prior to `Varsity' there is a reasonable amount of detail and thinking about this first combat jump, though the actual fighting phase is quite brief. Upon landing Wilson assists with finding, assembling and firing his piece. He is under fire on the ground (and in the air beforehand) but this is not delivered in a gripping or minutely detailed way. He sees casualties and dead and captured Germans but the author is a reticent/reserved man so this phase is lacking much in the way of excitement.The author is clearly the real deal in terms of being a combat soldier (and was being shipped to the Pacific for more - back with the 13th Division I think) so full credit to him but this book is an uninspiring read. He just didn't see enough combat. And while there are spots of interest, there is not much in the training phase that stands out either. This book does fill a void in that it deals with a unit and a battle that is not often mentioned. However, it offers very little to change this state of affairs. Not recommended for anyone who is not an airborne obsessive.
Summary 4: Very interesting book. we know the author and have heard his of his experiences during the war. The book is informative and interesting, they were a brave bunch of men. Highly recomend it to everyone.
Summary 5: This personal momoir adds to the body of World War II history."
B000HSZ5GY,LEGACY: The Story of Talula Gilbert Bottoms and Her Quilts,"Summary 1: This book's accomplishment is stunning. I've read it three times, each time discovering new layers of meaning. This is one of those books that becomes part of one's experience. The best kind.It also affords a model for the work of any aspiring cultural or material historian. And certainly it offers a student of quilt history and/or women's history a rare model and an extraordinarily complex and detailed picture of the life of one woman and her quilts in one time and place.The book is completely belied by the determinedly and obviously biased views of two reviewers who posted to Amazon.com reviews. I cannot help wondering if they read the same book I read. Their criticism is of the South, not of the book. And it is a criticism of a stereotypical South, at that, not a region far too complex to comprehend in one sweep of bias. And certainly not the world captured in its minutae in this book.LEGACY: THE STORY OF TALULA GILBERT BOTTOM AND HER QUILTS is not an apologia for the Confederacy or a condemnation of the Union in the Civil War, though a portion of it describes---one feels accurately and certainly matter-of-factly---the experience of a southern family caught up in the terrible combat of that war. To read it as two critics read it requires a bias so strong it precludes access to the real meaning of this remarkable story that moves from the ante-bellum South through two world wars with equal passion and loss.The title is ""Legacy: The Story of Talula Gilbert Bottoms and her Quilts,"" and its writer discovers in the many quilts created in good times and bad the meaning of her legacy from her grandmother. That legacy is most essentially a determined courage to accept life as it comes, without complaint or self-pity, but with a spirit of optimism and endurance that is nurtured by the creation of beauty.The admiration heard in the authorial voice is, therefore, appropriate. And it is not sentimental. With the author, we discover her grandmother. And along with her, through her grandmother's quilts and the little autobiography Talula left, we come to admire this tough little woman who persevered through rheumatism and overwork, wars and contagions, poverty and modest economic security, and all the while continued to turn out meticulously wrought quilts individualized by her devotion to her craft and to her family, for whom she created these quilts.Burdick lets Talula and her quilts speak, and there is not a drop of self-pity in either.For anyone wanting to know what life was like for an ordinary white family in the Deep South from the mid-19th century through, say, WW II, ""Legacy"" offers an exceptional gift. There they are--the daily routines, the backbreaking farm and house work, the religious devotion and struggles, the children who die from diseases that left cemeteries full of tiny tombstones. But there also are the joys and devotions of family, the love of place, the achievement in the face of obstacles, and always--always--the quilts that defined one woman's values and meanings of life.In little things--for instance, in the problems created when the young bride Talula spilled into the well some of the milk she was keeping cold there--we come to understand her world and her achievement.In her study, Burdick has relied on techniques common to an approach more recently designated by material historian James Deetz as ""material behaviors."" Deetz expands the means of the material historian beyond the description and identification of artifacts. He suggests the inclusion of cognitive, psychological, spiritual behaviors to discover the fuller meaning of the material objects.That is exactly what Burdick does with her grandmother's quilts. She places them in their natural context in order to make sense of them, to discover what they reveal about their art, their craft, about their maker.And she does it so well, we forget for the reading that we too are not kinsmen of Talula Gilbert Bottoms.The quiltmaking of the backcountry South is insufficiently documented and understood. This book goes a long way to remediating those problems.The existing journals of Southern women in the nineteenth century are most often those of women of considerable means, for they were the ones who could afford education. This book provides balance to those, for it describes and analyzes the life of a woman who had struggled to make herself literate, but whose means and circumstances precluded her achieving the exceptional feats she and her husband made accessible to their children, who achieved acclaim in science. The reader will find no moonlight-and-magnolias version of southern life in LEGACY.But he will find truth.It should be noted that the writer's style is lively and vigorous (She is an English professor in New York state), the photographs of the quilts and of the Bottomses well done and complementary to the text, and the book generally set in an attractive format.I came away from this book with a far better understanding of life for the ordinary family in the hinterland South and of the role quilts played in the lives of such families and of the women who made them. I also acquired a better appreciation for the quilts themselves and a more informed view of the quilts produced in the Southern backcountry. It is, for instance, generally presumed that poverty accounts for most choices of hinterland quilts. Yet Talula Bottoms experienced grave poverty, teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for a long time, but all the while found the means to create well-planned and executed quilts.What a pleasure Ms. Burdick gives in her thoughtful, important book on her grandmother and her grandmother's quilts. I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys biography, women's or quilt history, cultural history, or who loves quilts. And it is salutary to anyone who needs to see courage in the flesh. A very good read!
Summary 2: I took this family history for what it was , , , one account of both the trials and joys in the life of a one woman and her family. That these happened to begin in the south post Civil War era was part of that story. And, the historical view points where that of the south during that time. For those who are disturbed by these and would like a pure factual account of this period in our country's history, I suggest that you watch the PBS series,""The Civil War"" produced by Ken Burns. This book is not the place to look for those facts. This is a book of ""Remembrances"". I loved this book. Talula's outlook on life was uniquely her own. Not all women during that period of history could have adjusted to her circumstances. In fact, her older sister had a much more difficult time. The south was totally economically destroyed. And many times it fell on the shoulders of the women to carry on after their husbands left them alone with children to feed and care for.Take note of Talula's personal philosophy: ""Whatever happens, I will not worry. If a thing can be helped, I will help it: if not, I will make the best of it."" She makes mention of her ""fingers itching to get to her quilting."" Her love of her family, of God and of making her quilts sustained her through the most horrible circumstances one could imagine. That she managed to make by hand between 200 - 300 quilts during her lifetime while looking after her family through sickness and death, sorrow and personal loss while maintaining a lifeline in her letters to family members was beyond my comprehension. If only for the pictures of Talula's quilts, I would recommend this book - the story is the icing on the cake! And I would certainly describe it as a love story . . . love between a husband and wife, a woman and her family, and of the quilts she lovingly made for them.
Summary 3: A great combination of quilts and the lives of the quilters that made them. The book shows the hard times and lives of these ladies and how quilting worked into their daily lives. A great read in between your own quilting projects. And a great gift for a quilter friend too.
Summary 4: THIS IS FOR SURE A 5 STAR BOOK. I am so glad I found this wonderful book, what an education, so much to be learned from people from this time.
Summary 5: Although I purchased this book to read about the quilts that were made by Talula Gilbert Bottoms, the overtly magnanimous overtures about Mrs. Burdick's grandparents basically overpowered the story. There are beautiful pictures of the quilts so lovingly made by Mrs. Talula Bottoms, but the saga about her life was just too sanctimoniously written, in my humble opinion, especially those of the trials of Mrs. Bottoms' young life. The excerpts taken from the memoirs of Talula G. Bottoms was, in fact, more interesting to me, and I wish that the author - the granddaughter of Mrs. Bottoms - had utilized more of the original papers instead of the overall, overtly gushing writing style that I found indicative of Mrs. Burdick."
B0007FDG1S,George Mueller,"Summary 1: If you want to learn about a man that truly lived for Jesus. George is the guy. He will explain how it is done. So you can do it too.
Summary 2: Set in the slums of Bristol, England during the 1830's through the 1840's. Faith Coxe Bailey's story of George Mueller is about a man's trust in God to supply an orphanage with 300 orphans, and the essentials to live with.George trusts God to guide him through the building of a home for unwanted children. He lives day to day, and sometimes hour to hour, praying for food and clothing for the children. Throughout the book, George wants people to believe that God answers prayers. That is why he will not ask for anything from anyone, because he relies on God to provide.In this scene from the book, George had just purchased the house that was to be used as the orphanage. He prayed to God for all of the emenities needed and within an hour, George received a huge bundle of dishes from an unknown individual.This book shows that God provides and takes care of His children. And the power of prayer can supply your needs, whatever they may be.
Summary 3: Our Church Book Club (of adults) chose to read this book. It was a very easy book, but so inspiring. Everyone enjoyed it so much. What a wonderful story about how one man can trust God for everything, and what he was able to do for orphans through that trust.
Summary 4: This book was very encouraging and an easy read. A must read for those who want to be encouraged in their prayer life.
Summary 5: This book was great and such a lovely ending. It was a little bit sad at the end. I still love it though!!!"
B000I3JBYA,The Myth of the State,"Summary 1: This insightful book marks the end of Ernst Cassirer's career and suggests that his impact upon the social sciences will continue to grow. Perhaps this book's central feature is it's application of Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms to 20th century political thought. Beginning with a lean and incisive analysis of myth and culminating with an inspection of modern authoritarianism, Cassirer succeeds in marrying an understanding of culture with an analysis of political phenomena. Readers familiar with the Western tradition of political philosophy will find their background knowledge put to good use here, as the majority of the text centers around considering various mythic conceptions prevalent in Western political theory up to Hitler's Third Reich. Cassirer's approach, consistent with his other works, is to stress synthetic conclusions with comprehensive analysis.The text can be divided into roughly three major section, each of which draws from Cassirer's previous work. The first major section is Cassirer's short exposition of his philosophy of symbolic forms. The reader is provided with several chapters identifying key elements of myth, including language, emotions, and social life. From this domain, Cassirer draws a general theory of culture, and a theory of myth in particular. His orientation to studying culture is largely operative, as he considers how myth functions emotively, cognitively, and socially.In the next section, Cassirer approaches the question of the Western state's origins, particularly in relation to the Greek, medieval, and Renaissance traditions. All through reviewing major political theories (e.g. Machiavelli, Hegel, etc.), Cassirer applies his functional analysis of myth, noting how Western thought developed out of myth, but does not entirely escape its influence. The final section finds Cassirer considering the genesis of modern totalitarianism, once again by working through influential thinkers. Among these include Hegel's formulation of the State, Thomas Carlyle's hero worship, and Joseph A. C. de Gobineau's theory of racism.The last chapter, entitled ""The Technique of Modern Political Myths"" will be the most fascinating for reader's familiar with Cassirer's other major works. Here we find Cassirer in high form: An advocate of Kant's Aufklarung in an uncertain world shaped by powerful, misunderstood forces of culture. Sadly, Cassirer passed away suddenly before this section could be completed. Still, the final note is resounding. Writing in an unusually strong tone about how to address the advocates and agents of political myths, Cassirer concludes: ""We should see the adversary face to face in order to know how to combat him."" In this task, Cassirer advocates that philosophy is our chief tool in understanding myth and that this task is necessary to advance self-understanding beyond even contemporary bounds.
Summary 2: While Ernst Cassirer provides an illuminating analysis of the nature of myth in The Myth of the State, he never tells his reader what the western myth of the state is. Extrapolating from his analysis of Plato, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Carlyle, the racist Gobineau, Hegel, et al, what emerges is the unfolding of a theory of the state, not a mythos of it. The passionate and emotive elements of myth, which Cassirer brilliantly explicates about myth in general, are never made explicit in his analysis of the theory (""myth"") of the state (except at the end when he discusses Nazism). If anything, these elements are subsumed in the content of his analysis.Nevertheless, Cassirer masterfully explains much of the development of the western theory of the state through time. He hits on many of the salient thinkers and philosophical movements. Yet, inexplicably, some important thinkers seem to get short shrift comparatively speaking (e.g. Aristotle) and others scarcely manage more than a brief mention (e.g. Marx). Readers might find (what turned out to be) Cassirer's parting shot at Heidegger and the proto-fascist elements of his philosophy fascinating (Cassirer died in 1945 and The Myth of the State was published posthumously). Perhaps most intriguing is how Cassirer reserves most of his ire for Hegel, arguably making his philosophy most responsible for the intellectual underpinnings of the rise of National Socialism in Germany--an analysis not entirely unpredictable for a neo-Kantian like Cassirer to make given how, in the historical estimation of many, Hegel eclipsed Kant as Germany's preeminent philosopher.Notwithstanding these limitations, The Myth of the State is worth reading. Cassirer's analysis of the development of the western theory of the state is evidently too sagacious to be missed.
Summary 3: Can a book be both lucidly written, highly erudite and yet completely meaningless?It seems that it can.""The Myth of the State"" by Neo-Kantian philosopher Ernst Cassirer is such a book. The positive reviewers were obviously taken in by Cassirer's unusually lucid style of writing, and by his erudition, which is considerable.And yet, the book never really delivers. It's supposed to be an analysis of the historic and philosophical roots of modern totalitarianism. Instead, it feels like a series of disjointed essays about pretty much everything. Subjects covered include the meaning and function of myth, the exact relationship between Carlyle and Goethe, whether or not Machiavelli really was Old Nicky, the Romantic criticism of the Enlightenment, the racism of Gobineau, and countless other subjects besides. However, Cassirer never manages to weave the strands together. Interestingly, he never mentions Marx, Lenin or Nietzsche, the usual whipping boys in books of this type.Apparently, the book is unfinished and was published posthumously. I don't deny that it may contain this or that interesting reflection, but overall it feels like a non-starter. I suspect it's mostly of interest to scholars of Neo-Kantianism. Curiously, Cassirer (or perhaps his publisher) also expected the American audience to understand Latin and German (!), since all Latin quotations and some German ones are untranslated.Unfortunately, I cannot give ""The Myth of the State"" more than two stars."
B000MV8HFM,Bulbs,"Summary 1: Considering myself to be only an average (although passionate) gardener, I purchased this book because I was looking for a good reference on the topic of bulbs. An amazingly exhaustive volume that was honored by the American Horticulture Society and named one of '75 Great American Garden Books', 'Bulbs' by John E. Bryan is almost overwhelming for the average gardener.The beginning chapters of 'Bulbs' cover the normal gardening topics such as a brief bulb history, nomenclature, propagation, cultivation, forcing, and pests & diseases. The main bulk of the book (and it's real use) is the alphabetical listing of bulbs by genus. Included in each genus listing are general historical and general remarks followed by advice on their culture, pests and diseases, propagation methods and an amazingly complete listing of the species. The 1,171 photographs in the book are compiled alphabetically in three sections of plates, meaning that to see the plant photo referenced in the text you have to flip to the plant photo plate section of the book. These photos are (IMHO) generally of good quality and include flower close-ups, the entire plant, historical flower drawings/plates as well as pictures of some of the bulbs in the wild of mixed quality.What makes this book seem overwhelming to the average gardener (i.e. me) is the sheer amount of information (in comparison to other gardening books). Following the listing of each species is a description of the plant, (possibly) individual cultural information and a list of known cultivars. In the case of very large or extensively hybridized genuses (i.e. tulipa) where there are many different 'families' of plants (i.e. Single early tulips, Darwin hydrid tulips, Lily-flowered tulips, etc), the families of plants are listed and described in detail with a few representative cultivars listed followed by the individual species. Because of this, 'Bulbs' can seem decidedly 'unfriendly' toward the average gardener (i.e. someone who just wants to look up the best red tulip cultivars). Furthermore, because 'Bulbs' lists all of the known species within the genus and not just the common 'garden worthy' varieties, I found it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of entries. However, it is also this completeness that also makes this book an invaluable reference for the more advanced gardeners, collectors and scientists alike. (In the case of the extensively hybridized genuses (i.e. tulips and daffadils), a more specialized reference book would probably be more appropiate than this through bulb survey.)Overall, I believe that 'Bulbs' is an amazingly through book, but perhaps a little too through for the average gardener (I'm still keeping an eye open for a good garden bulb book - and I'm not a big fan of those smaller sized Taylor guides - any suggestions?). For the serious gardener, though, this book is a must read.
Summary 2: After reviewing many books on bulbs, this one has risen to the top. It is easily the most thorough and up-to-date reference covering the full range of geophytes.One of the features I like best in this book is the short, easy to read and well-diagrammed Botany and Classification of Bulbs chapter. It is a very well written introduction that includes explanations of the jargon and theories used by taxonomists and horticulturists. This is a great intro for early students of horticulture to grasp the bigger picture.The majority of the book is an A-Z, with accompanying line drawings as well as hundreds of color images. Each entry covers the family, culture, pests and disease, propagation, and all relevant species. The use of the new family classification is appreciated, with a handy reference to the previous family in parenthesis.Speaking of families, there is a great explanation of all the families of bulbous plants in Appendix A. Appendix B has all the bulbs around the world listed by country of habitat. The list of flowering time is not particularly useful though becuase it only breaks down into the 4 seasons. Early, mid, and late season classifications would be nice. There is a short list of plants for specific purposes - fragrance, cutting, etc. There is a very thorough bibliography and a common name index.This is a large and heavy book, but worth every penny. The descriptions are written in an easy to read style and it is the most thorough and complete book on bulbs I have seen.
Summary 3: This is an excellent reference book, listing all types of bulbs, from the common garden variety to the more obscure varieties. Listings also include all the hybrids and new cultivars. The book is well set out with many colour photos of the different species. A must for any home library and avid gardeners anywhere."
8879112163,Formula 1 '99 Technical Analysis,"Summary 1: Let me start off by saying that if you are an F1 fan especially a technical one(like myself) you can't pass up this book. If you do not know who Giorgio Piola is, he draws for the weekly magazine AutoSport. He is one of the best artist I have seen. His technical drawings allow you to understand the F1 cars in a technical perspective. Compared to the last edition &quot;Technical Analysis 98&quot;, this one is even better. If you don't have the 98 book you should order that one too. I do like the 99 book since it is written in english only as opposed to the 98 which is in italian and english, but thats not a problem. What will really impress you is the attention to detail of the drawings, but they are so easy to understand. Again this is a must for any F1 fan. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
Summary 2: The best book for anyone who is interested in the technical side of modern F1. The coloured illustration that make up the book are top class, clearly showing the differences between the different cars no matter how minute. The section following the development if Ferrari and McLaren from race to race is superb. Those hoping for an explanation for the different designs and the concepts behind them should look for other books, though I doubt you'll find one thanks to F1's secrecy, but for those who would like to really view the cars in all their beauty there is nothing to match this book.
Summary 3: I've read this book and own the complete following series.It's a good reference for that year, but the sport has moved on FAR beyond this and it's lessons are very dated.If you're interested in current technology, buy an edition from later years/series. If your interested in the technology of the era, look up Peter Wright's ""Formula 1 Technology"" and compare prices. Wright's book is FAR superior, especially putting the technology in context and especially if the price is nearly the same.That's even speaking as a Ferrari supporter since the Niki Lauda era..."
B000N65G1Y,Our Country,"Summary 1: Two warnings: First, the book is long. Second, the author is conservative and doesn't make an effort to hide it. If these facts don't disturb you then I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is a wonderful story of twentieth-century American politics, crammed with polls, stats, and insightful commentary. Why has ethnicity been a more important factor in politics than class? How did the political pendulum shift from conservatism to liberalism to conservatism again? Who are some of the most important statesmen in history that you've never heard of? And much, much more. If Michael Barone's &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; is the Holy Bible of politics, then this work is a book of prayer.
Summary 2: Barone knows American political history inside and out. He gives the reader crisp, incisive portraits of individuals from Henry Wallace to Jack Kemp, of legislation from the Taft-Hartley Act to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- and he shows the reader how these people and measures fit into and shaped the world as it existed in their time. (The first two chapters, in which he presents brief portraits of Chief Justice William Howard Taft and Tammany Hall politico Charles Murphy, brilliantly illuminate how Republicans and Democrats thought and felt about their country in the early 1920s.) In addition, Barone knows the hard data of politics -- survey results, voting patterns, demographics -- and analyzes them in ways which often produce striking insights. His analysis of the timing and nature of the New Deal realignment, and the patchy and hesitant way in which liberal policies came to be accepted in the three decades or so following 1932, ought to be read by anyone interested in how ideological shifts really take place in American politics. Lastly, Barone (a journalist and former Democratic activist) recognizes and respects the achievements of the United States in the twentieth century -- and doesn't define &quot;achievement&quot; solely as &quot;movement towards the political left&quot; (as many other writers on American history, even sincere admirers like Harold Evans, sometime seem to do.) I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone with an interest in twentieth-century political and social change.
Summary 3: Michael Barone is the co-creator (with Grant Ujifusa) of the Almanac of American Politics, itself an almost inexhaustible well of the curious and (sometimes) interesting. Our Country is an effort to put the same sensibility to work in a narrative history. Barone has absorbed a lot and forgotten little, and he likes to remind the reader of things others are more likely to forget. Civil rights, for example. One wing of the Republican party had its roots planted firmly in the abolitionist movement, dating back to before the Civil War. You could call it &quot;the Eisenhower wing,&quot; if you were clear that it did not include Eisenhower. As general, and later as president, it seems fair to say that Eisenhower just didn't get it - not so much hostility to blacks as a kind of blank incomprehension - why weren't they willing to keep the place (one is tempted to make comparisons with General Sherman). Lyndon Johnson, by contrast, is one who emphatically did get it. Vulnerable and insecure as he always saw himself, Johnson was able to show real empathy for the plight of American Blacks. So we have the kind of irony so familiar in politics - the soldier-statesman who didn't get it, imposing a civil rights bill on Congress against the best efforts of the cracker politician who did.Barone obviously relishes the irony there, but he likes the story in particular because of an even more consistent enthusiasm. That is: he is fascinated by the hard work of governing, which he comes close to glamorizing in its very unglamorousness. You can see it perhaps best in his appreciative account of a man who he nominates as a forgotten progenitor of modern social legislation - Robert Wagner, the senator and father, inter alia, of the Wagner Labor Relations Act. Without Wagner, as Barone tells it, the New Deal's legislative agenda would have been a lot more insipid. It perhaps explains also his affection for Hubert Humphrey - a name perhaps mostly forgotten today, or remembered if at all only in the sour aftertaste of the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Richard Nixon.What perhaps gives zest to Barone's account is that for all his skill as a data-miner, he believes at the end that politics is culture and not economics that divides us or draws us together. It impels him to insist that there is a society more important than its contentions and divisions, more than the sum of its parts - in some sense, a res publica, or (back to Barone's title here) &quot;Our Country.&quot; Only one afterthought: this is another book that cries out for an new edition.
Summary 4: Sorry, I only read the first 35 or 40 pages. The recounting of legislative actions was too uninteresting. I am interested in tid-bits of human activity. So I put the book down, and will not waste my time with it. People like F.D. R. are boring, whereas the farmer and the housewife, working their way through life, make history."
B000NSJFPU,The Gardener,"Summary 1: ""Please, make me the gardener of your flower garden"", a lover asks his beloved. He calls himself a servant and his beloved the queen. He dreams to serve her idle days. He wants to keep fresh the grassy path where she walks in the morning; he wants her feet to be greeted with praise at every step by the flowers.And what he wants for his reward? He asks to be allowed to hold her little fists like tender lotus-buds and slip flower chains over her wrists; to tinge the soles of her feet with the red juice of flower petals and kiss away the speck of dust that may chance to linger there.This is the way Rabindranath Tagore, the greatest Indian poet of all times, introduce us to this enchanted collection of poems, poems that touch the most profound strings of our hearts. His poems tell us about love and life - and they are rich with the description of nature and beauty. Anybody that loves or has loved cannot remain indifferent to his poems. Some readers ""have smiles, sweet and simple, and some a sly twinkle in their eyes. Some have tears that well up in the daylight, and others tears that are hidden in the gloom."" But we all have need for him, the poet, who is ""ever as young or as old as the youngest and the oldest of the village"".His poems tell us of impossible love - like the love of the free bird and the cage bird: ""Their love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing. Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each other. They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!' The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.' The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.' ""His poems tell us of secret love: ""The young traveler came along the road in the rosy mist of the morning. He stopped before my door and asked me with an eager cry, 'Where is she?' For very shame I could not say, 'She is I, young traveler, she is I.' ""His poems tell us of lovers' emotion: ""When my love comes and sits by my side, when my body trembles and my eyelids droop, the night darkens, the wind blows out the lamp, and the clouds draw veils over the stars. It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light. I do not know how to hide it.""His poems tell us of the need for love confidence: ""Do not keep to yourself the secret of your heart, my friend! Say it to me, only to me, in secret. You who smile so gently, softly whisper, my heart will hear it, not my ears.""His poems tell us of a love story: ""Hands cling to hands and eyes linger on eyes: thus begins the record of our hearts. It is the moonlit night of March; the sweet smell of henna is in the air; my flute lies on the earth neglected and your garland of flowers is unfinished. This love between you and me is simple as a song.""His poems tell us of lovers departing: ""An unbelieving smile flits on your eyes when I come to you to take my leave. I have done it so often that you think I will soon return. To tell you the truth I have the same doubt in my mind. For the spring days come again time after time; the full moon takes leave and comes on another visit, the flowers come again and blush upon their branches year after year, and it is likely that I take my leave only to come to you again. But keep the illusion awhile; do not send it away with ungentle haste. When I say I leave you for all time, accept it as true, and let a mist of tears for one moment deepen the dark rim of your eyes. Then smile as archly as you like when I come again.""Reading those poems I felt like visiting a flower garden full of scents and beauty in a magic ancient kingdom.
Summary 2: I've heard of Rabindranath Tagore and his poetry ever since I the fifth grade when my literature teacher used to quote him on an occasion. At the time I didn't understand much of what those poems were about, but was interested in reading eventually reading them on my own. Over the years I had not though much about it, but in recent years my interest in poetry has been rekindled. When I came across several of his poetry collection on Amazon I decided to take a look at them and see what the hype was all about.Tagore was the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize. Unfortunately, Nobel Prize in literature has had a rather checkered history. Many of its early recipients are largely forgotten today, and many of the recent prizes have been given for political, rather than literary, reasons. I approached Tagore's poems with a grain of salt, but my skepticism proved to be unwarranted. His poetry is of the highest caliber, and his literary reputation is well deserved. He is not read much in the English-speaking world any more, which is a shame. He deserves to be rediscovered and his poetry reintroduced to the new generation of readers.""The Gardener"" is a collection of love poems, where the lover compares himself to a gardener and the beloved to his queen. The verses are intricately woven and they explore the depths of love, its anguish as well as the sublime desires. The poems are rich with imagery and allegory. As in many others of Tagore's works, these love poems can be read on many levels, but they are particularly perceptive of our innermost spiritual strivings.
Summary 3: excellent collection of indian poetry. found it accidently while browsing in a huge 6 story library. quite a lucky find.
Summary 4: Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!
Summary 5: I ordered the audio book and have listened to it over and over. I never get tired of the story and hope that anyone interested in nature will read or listen to it.What a great story, with many hidden meanings. I love it!"
1420832786,The Gift of Reiki,"Summary 1: I have been teaching Reiki for many years using different books, finally there is a book that is clear and has all the correct information in a format a beginner can understand. This book explains the Reiki story so clearly without disclaiming the original story that appears in most other Reiki books. The pictures of the hand placements are wonderful and I like the additional placements also. I believe the stories throughout the book add a special dimension showing the flexibility and depth that Reiki can be used. This book has taken the number one position in my Reiki library. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Summary 2: I highly recommend this Reiki book. It is a wonderful guide for a beginner like myself. The photos are clear and the writing is interesting and insightful.
Summary 3: This book offers the gift of Reiki to all. It is a solid teaching tool for Reiki classes as well as a how-to for self healing. Included are testimonials offering new insights and ideas gleaned from the actual experiences of those using Reiki both on self and others. The book incorporates spiritual wisdom from many traditions in support of the healing process. The layout, combining illustrations and text, makes the techniques easy to visualize. Less is more yet it is all there and works in harmony presenting history, technique, and healing in one easy-to-use source. I sometimes just open the book and reread the wisdom notes for inspiration. It is gentle; it is spirit."
B000KDO2II,Gone Is Gone Or The Story Of A Man Who Wanted To Do Housework,"Summary 1: This is a timeless story of the question that has plagued every couple...who works the hardest? It is such a great story for little girls (and boys) and my daughter loved it! Now every time we get to the part where the husband asks to take over the wife's tasks for a day and says &quot;how hard could it be?&quot;, my daughter rolls her eyes and says &quot;Oh sure&quot;...
Summary 2: Gone Is Gone is one of the great children's books, not only because of its prose style and the beautiful illustrations, along with the wonderful humor, but because it sends a message that reverberates in this day of women's lib and gender-neutral family roles. It SHOULD BE REISSUED in an affordable edition!
Summary 3: Highly recommend this book for any age! Beautiful sketches and nicely packaged. Excellent transaction - quick delivery, easy payment method."
061361657X,Silver Seeds: A Book Of Nature Poems (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition),"Summary 1: I saw this book displayed in a book store &amp; I was with my kids. They both ran up to it, sat on the floor and spent the next hour glued to it. I took a curious look to find it was beautiful, educational and inspiring. I bought the book for my kids, my nieces, my nephews &amp; my friend's kids. More books of beauty, hope &amp; inspiration should be available for my children. Maybe these authors should consider a Silver Seeds two!
Summary 2: I wrote a similar review for Steven Schnur's ""Summer; an Alphabet Acrostic"", and much of what I said applies here. I love to see writers take a tired old language arts exercise, or old poetry style, and spice it up a bit, or at least make it a little more interesting. These are fine, clever acrostics, yet simple enough for everyone to enjoy. The artwork is soft, yet colorful, with large, up close images, and there is a peacefulness to the overall feel of the book. I recommend this one to the kids with whom I work, and to adults! A nice book!
Summary 3: This was an excellent business transaction. The product was in excellent condition and arrived a timely manner. Great doing business with you, Thanks!"
0471198145,Learning to Program with Visual Basic,"Summary 1: Without any knowledge of programming whatsoever, the reader learns the main programming aims (input, storage, evaluation, repetition, comparison/selection, and output) using Visual Basic as an example paradigm.A lot of hands-on exercises are provided throughout. A complete application is gradually developed through all the chapters, together with smaller applications which illustrate specific points.While the editing of the book leaves something to be desired (e.g., incomplete sentences, punctuation errors, occasional code inaccuracies), this is a very worthwhile book indeed. I highly recommend it for the author's lack of assumptions and obvious understanding of the beginner's needs.
Summary 2: This book probably throws more information at you, page for page, than any other Visual Basic book I've seen. It covers everything from programming basics and general theory, all the way up to programming with databases. In that regard, it's an ideal book for the novice who wishes to explore deeper.Unfortunately, what keeps this from being a truly great textbook is some really sloppy editing. Explanations of concepts and tools are thorough to a fault, but they are just way too verbose. Here, a long explanation is used where a short one would have sufficed. And most inexcusably, I have found numerous errors in the project code that is included. I made it a challenge to myself to find out why the code was wrong and correct it, but not everyone has a learning style that allows them to benefit from this. Apparently, some of these problems are corrected in a third edition of the book that is forthcoming. Until that time, proceed with caution.
Summary 3: We were given this book for my programming class and the author is very long winded on every topic and a lot of times you read the topic and when finished you are more confused than when you started so you end up going to a different book for better understanding.The code for the projects are broken up into seperate chunks and he doesn't always give you all of the code needed to make the program work or his code is wrong so you spend more time trying to find the problem and get it to work than learning the topic that the code is supposed to teach you.The index of the book tends to be off the majority of the time so when you need to look something up it will not be on the page that it says it's on. I went to the publisher's website for a page with the error corrections but they only correct a few items and I spotted a ton more in the book that I feel is critical to get the code to work.If you are really interested in learning Visual Basic 6 I would suggest going for a different book than this, this book is not worth the money.
Summary 4: A book able to explain VB 6 in simple words with simplicity,I just bought the book for a program (VB 98) dated back to 1998, but a good book from the use I am given to it. All the topics are treated with sense and simplicity, making the language of programming easy. Good for everyone interested to learn the basics of VB 98.
Summary 5: This book takes great pains to offer several different projects for a student to learn from. Unfortunately the main project, which is the most interesting, has several coding errors that hinder the project's ability to run. I found myself spending more time trying to correct the coding errors than learning from the presented material.This was my first introduction to VB, and the first four chapters were very beneficial. Then I hit a wall, as coding errors prevented me from continuing with the project.Also, the associated trial software has a few glitches. Most notably, and most annoying, was the fact that the utility allowing a VB project to be saved as an EXE was unavailable, for whatever reason. I registered the product correctly, and was well within the 120 day trial period. This limited my ability to bring the project to work to examine it further.Finally, the web site for student help listed in the book was unavailable for the entire month of January. I gave up at the end of January.I do intend to keep this book as a reference tool, and look forward to finding the correct codes to make the entire project work when I learn more about VB. Until then, I will find a different book to utilize."
B000MC13M0,The Dictionary of Blue and White Printed Pottery 1780-1880,"Summary 1: The most comprehensive references on transferware pottery are basically boring lists: You use them to reference a specific item, and not much else.This book is so much more.It's a top reference work, but is also the sort of book you can put on the coffee table - or curl up with in bed for an absorbing couple of hours reading.Highly recommended.
Summary 2: Very informative, but the vast majority of the photos are black and white! Not ideal. I would not have purchased the book had this been made known.
Summary 3: Books on transferware (blue and white) pottery are very hard to find. And it's even harder to find a good one, that has enough information to be useful.This is a VERY nice reference book for transferware pottery. While not every pattern is pictured (an impossible feat considering how many different patterns there are), there are dozens and dozens of example pictures through out. Beautiful patterns - some of which I had never seen before. They also show numerous examples of the original painting or sketch or engraving next to the transferware pattern, which I found very interesting. Many makers/manufacturers marks and date stamps are covered also.This book doesn't even attempt to assign monetary prices to the patterns, but as a reference book you can't beat it. Well worth the money!"
0375753494,"The Young Entrepreneur's Edge: Using Your Ambition, Independence, and Youth to Launch a Succesful Business (Career Guides)","Summary 1: If you've ever wondered what running your own business would be like you really only have two choices: look towards the sky and daydream or give it a shot. If you choose the later, Kushell's The Young Entrepreneur's Edge can help you along that path.The book is basically a ""how to"" for starting a business. It presents and answers all of the questions that you might really need to know the answer to, but felt too stupid to ask. It also touches on many things that a first-time entrepreneur may be unaware of or forget (like IRS withholding, etc.).The book is primarily for someone planning to start a business for the first time and will offer little advice to the seasoned business-owner. Of value, though, especially to younger readers (of all levels of business experience) are the sections on dealing with perception of youth in a business context which may get a more thorough treatment here than in any other manuscript. Entrepreneurs of all ages and experience-levels will also enjoy the start-up-stories that pepper the book.The books one real lack, however, may be in the accuracy department. For example, Kushell gets the IRS 1099 and W2 form confused, which may seem like a simple mistake but could inadvertently subject a business to a variety of liability (W2 employees are the traditional salaried/wage employees where the 1099 form is used for reporting income for independent contractors - [website] has extensive information on tax forms). The book, thus, is a good overview and may alert you to things that need to be looked into further, but additional research will be required to verify and understand each topic.Overall, the book is a must-read for anyone under 30 starting a ""real"" business for the first time. For others, it may serve as a refresher or provide an amusing read, but will be of limited usefulness.
Summary 2: I recently had the pleasure of reading &quot;The Young Entrepreneur's Edge&quot; by Jennifer Kushell. Jennifer is the President and Founder of the Young Entrepreneurs Network, an organization dedicated to helping the next generation succeed in owning their own business. This book was written for the twenty-something's, but I'm thirty-something and thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gives a lot of practical information you can use in order to succeed in any business at any age. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to start their own business. I wish I had read it before I got started. Its a great reference guide.
Summary 3: The Young Entrepreneur's Edge is not so much a how-to book on starting your own business, but is really a ""how-to-cope-with-life-while-starting-and-succeeding-in-your-own-business-book."" I have read many books on starting your own business and this book has some very unique advice because it is geared towards younger entrepreneurs. Jennifer Kushell offers some practical advice about selecting the right business for you, writing a business plan, getting funded, etc. But what sets the book apart are its sections on not having any credit or not having good credit, using interns instead of full time employees, how to get mentors and advisors, how to present a professional image despite of your youthful looking appearance, dealing with family and friends who don't support your decision, how not to starve, etc. The only complaint that I had about the book was that some sections were not very complete on their advice. It is true that there are lots of other books out there on subjects such as marketing and business plans and so on, but if the author was just going to recommend that we look elsewhere, why did she include a chapter on that topic in the book in the first place? Some of the information is a little dated, but not too bad. I also would have like to have seen more resources to go to in the back of the book as to where to go to get that information that she doesn't cover in the book. Regardless, if you are a twenty-something or younger entrepreneur, there are some really helpful hints to be found in this book and it is well worth your time to read for Jennifer Kushell's upbeat attitude and encouragement. She is absolutely right in that there is no better time for young entrepreneurs to go into business then now, when we have little or nothing to lose.
Summary 4: I dont really think that this is a good book. I didnt know anything more after reading this book then I knew before reading this book. I found the most valuable information she provided was telling about how she saved money using interns, yet this was something that I already knew also.
Summary 5: I'm very disappointed with this book. Very vague and broad examples and not a lot of the nuts and bolts of success. Jennifer Kushell is the self crowned princess of the young entrepreneurial spirit. She claims to have launched successfull business ventures but never elaborates anywhere in her books or websites and instead offers page after page of fluff and filler on how to get ahead. After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand. Please save your time and money. There are many better choices by PROVEN success stories. Multiple streams of Income by Robert Allen and How to Buy a Business: Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition by Richard A. Joseph are two of many that are a much better read for your time and money"
9004119566,"The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament (Sinica Leidensia,) (vols 1-5)","Summary 1: The best English lexicon of biblical Hebrew &amp; Aramaic, KBL is also easier to use than the classic BDB. Words are listed alphabetically, rather than grouped by root, with cross-references to other words from the same root (no more trying to figure out a noun's putative &quot;verbal root&quot;). Akkadian tends to dominate the etymological information, rather than Arabic), along with Ugaritic. Glosses tend to be traditional, although references within the articles and the extensive supplementary bibliography (84 pages; alphabetically by author) allow you to find narrative lexical discussions. The Aramaic section is outstanding, with citations ranging far beyond biblical Aramaic. Although some might be tempted to begin with an &quot;intermediate&quot; lexicon such as Holladay, KBL's layout, clarity, and wealth of information makes this appropriate for both beginning students, pastors, teachers, and other scholars.
Summary 2: This lexicon should be in the library of anyone seeking to understand the deeper meanings of Hebrew words in Tanach. No one text stands alone in that regard; however, it is felt that Koehler - Baumgartner is indispensable for any serious student of Biblical Hebrew, and everyone is a student of this wonderful language. The 2-volume unabridged study edition is affordable and is more space efficient on the shelf. Buy this one with confidence.
Summary 3: The printed 5 volume set provides a fine supplementary lexicon for all students of the Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic. The volumes are finely bound, printed on acid-free paper (though not ANSI certified). Each volume is smyth sewn.Much more asthetic than using a computer screen, the printed version allows you to view all 5 volumes at the same time, even without electricity! Though it cannot compare with the search power of the CD version. The main text is in a two column format and all of the fonts are easy to read.These volumes will become the standard Hebrew Bible lexicon. Unfortunately! However they should be supplemented with other works because:(1) They do not show all of the needed etymologies, many entries display no etymological data. (Ernest Klein's work is recommended here). The data from North/West Semitics could be expanded, it is lacking in many entries. Hittite data seems deficient as well as some Sumerian data -- let's face it, they are early influences on the Semitic languages. The Koehler-Baum. work only skims the surface when it comes to etymologies.(2) Many important works by evangelical scholars (such as S. P. Tregelles, Gleason, Archer, Kyle Yates, E. Young, Robert Dick Wilson, et al) were not even utilized. Too much emphasis was given to the popular works done by secular scholars.(3) Ugaritic, Phoenician, Arabic and other fonts (scripts) are simply transliterated. They should have been printed out in their original script. Transliteration tables could have also been included for the scholars who are not familiar with these languages, but accuracy can be jeopardized when the original scripts are just transliterated, and it takes time and effort to &quot;recompose&quot; them. Perhaps they were transliterated so that the digital search engines could be simplified. Poor trade off!(4) Some important definitions are missing for some entries! Thus other lexicons are needed. For example: sh-r-Ha (shin, resh, he) in volume 4, pages 1652f does not show the meaning as &quot;to shine&quot; (from a possible Arabic root) nor as &quot;chains&quot; or &quot;bracelets&quot; as in Isaiah 3:19.(5) Textual variations are often not listed, and the Qumran literature and data could have been better utilized.(6) Foreign word indexes could have been supplied, and an index of Biblical passages could have been added. Several hands worked on the 5 volumes, and a variety of abbreviations are used for the Biblical books, making Biblical book cross references difficult even on the CD version.All in all, a very useful addition. The price is quite high and the folks at Brill often ask too much for their publications. The work NEEDS to be supplemented, and some entries are woefully deficient -- giving only a partial definition. Coupled with the poor etymological data -- this is not acceptable. Gary S. Dykes
Summary 4: This Lexicon is way above my paygrade, to hard to use. I'm sure people with PhD's get it. I will have to look for an easier book to use."
0966551303,The Missionary's Position,"Summary 1: The Missionary's Position by Gary Buslik. Sunny Books, New York, NY. 1999. 300 pp. $12.95 trade paper.The author claims to have gotten the inspiration for writing his humorous novel The Missionary's Position from being hit on the head with a coconut while vacationing on a Caribbean island. Set on two fictional Caribbean-like islands named Snow and St. Ursula, the novel follows the adventures--misadventures--of a zany cast of characters including the director of a local historical society, Philip Doyle; the fantastically wealthy Roberta Gibbleman and her mischievous daughter Wendy; and the comical despot Austin Sewer. The foil for setting these and related characters scheming and vying with one another is the competition between Doyle and Sewer to make their respective islands of Snow and St. Ursula the leading tourist attraction. A travel writer turning to fiction with this novel, Buslik hits just the right note in humorously portraying the carefree, gay ambience of a Caribbean island vacation spot and the casual, insouciant, dreamy but feckless behavior of its inhabitants. Page after page his writing is fresh and light-spirited--making The Missionary's Position ideal summer beach or travel-cruise reading.Henry Berry, Book Reviewer Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review
Summary 2: I liked idea of suspense story book set in Caribbean but plot is a bit thin and there are a lot of improbable scenes like selling your own baby, extremely rich and spoiled daughter has dozens of lovers, stretched limos on tiny island...There are more interesting stuff in some history books about real Caribbean islands.
Summary 3: Combines amazing literary skill with an outlandish, sneaky sense of humor which will have you laughing out loud. Images of the Caribbean, and Buslik's very colorful and satirical characters come alive. It's action packed, with enough twists and turns to keep you turning the pages like a high speed robot. I am buying this book for a friend of mine who is heading for Barbados.
Summary 4: Wow, how bad does it get.It was a chore to read this book. It contains the most unlikely and implausible plot. The characters seemed to be conjured up and very unreal. Not interesting, not funny, not entertaining and it was really hard work to get through it.I droppped my copy in the trash bin when I finished reading it. There is no way I could ever read it again and I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else.I've never felt this way about any other book. It was awful."
0963907093,Past Tense,"Summary 1: When it comes to defining a woman's role, PAST TENSE has blown through the glass ceiling! Both the protagonist and antagonist are dynamic and determined. . . equal opponents squaring off in a fast-paced, tension-filled arena. I loved the wonderful mix of humor, tension, passion, and surprises! Can't wait to see what the author writes next!
Summary 2: &quot;Past Tense is a thoroughly satisfying read, filled with passion, wit, and heart-warming characters. I couldn't put it down until the very last page.&quot;
Summary 3: The style is fresh and charming, peppered with dazzling metaphors. The plot never let me off the hook. It had me smiling with pleasure, shivering with anticipation or crying tears of emotion. Dana is portrayed as a person with many facets. The chemistry between Dana and Patrick is riveting and Dana's gentle love for her handicapped son got under my skin. A great book.
Summary 4: I have read Ms. Gettys' book, Past Tense, and found it to be an excellent read. The dialogue is crisp and tells the story without a lot of discriptive phrases. Her storyline is a good one and I found I could not put the book down and leave it for very long. I was anxious to see &quot;what happens now?&quot;. Ms. Gettys did an excellent job of completing all of the story lines. The reader is not left wondering what happened to this situation or that conflict. I am looking forward to reading more books by this author."
0375825940,Keeping Track of Thomas (Thomas & Friends) (Reusable Sticker Book),"Summary 1: My children have always loved sticker books and I have bought many many of them over my 20 plus years of parenting. I must stay this one, that I just bought for my son for his 8th birthday, has been the biggest disappointment in a sticker book that I can remember. Why? Because for a sticker book to be fun for a child, the stickers need to be totally cut away from the border paper so that the child isn't ripping them in half trying to get them off the page. This book's stickers are not die cut properly, and so after he ripped a few stickers, I had to cut around each of them to separate them from the border so he could use them. No fun for him, having ripped his first stickers, no fun for mom to have to cut out each sticker!! The book itself is big with lovely backround pictures to place the stickers on, but I rate it only 2 stars because the sticker quality must be there for a sticker book to be good for the child. Also, I found the stickers to be a bit ""thin""...for supposedly being a ""reusable"" sticker book (and we have rarely found in our vast sticker book experience that stickers actually are ""reusable"")and the stick isn't as strong as I would like to see. A sticker on the first stick should not be curling up on the edges.I would recommend that this company put this book out in a new form. Long ago, I used to be able to buy my oldest daughter sticker books with vinyl stickers (like colorforms) that were great and lasted a long time and actually were reusable. And vinyl stickers are 100% more durable than paper stickers...so much thicker, hence no ripping! If this Thomas book had vinyl stickers, it would be so nice! So sadly, we wasted $7 on a book he will be able to use only once, and due to the thin, not-so-very-sticky stickers, the finished result isn't even very attractive at that. So I do not recommend it.
Summary 2: This was very disappointing, we bought the Bob the Builder version for our 2 year old, and he had the same problems as the previous reviewer with stickers ripping. The reusability factor was also not there, after a 2 year old pulling them off and trying to reapply them just the first time, they were curling up at all the edges and not staying sticky. The other problem with this book is that the pages are non-contiguous posters, which means for him to use them as whole pictures, without pulling out 3 staples and then losing posters and stickers. All in all, I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a very poor book for little kiddos.
Summary 3: The stickers are so flimsy as to not survive more than one use by a three year old.
Summary 4: My 23-month-old LOVES this sticker book. He has been using it almost every day for a month, and he still loves it. I sit with him while he plays with it to help him bring the edges of the stickers up from the pages. The stickers are losing their stickiness now, but it was a good deal for a month of play!"
0970479522,The Principles and Philosophy of the Option Method,"Summary 1: This book will change your life if you can grasp it. It's message is deceptively simple which obscures the benefit from people who are looking for complicated answers. It proffers one simple truth and a method for experiencing that truth. It is what you are looking for! Buy it! Study it and wrestle with it until you get understand it. You will never be the same again.
Summary 2: Reading this book-I couldn't help but feel that I've wasted so muchof my life being unhappy by choice. I'll even venture to say thatthe option method could change the world as we know it if more peopleknew about it and practiced it.A book I'll continue to revisit throughout my life.

Summary 4: This is an important book for anyone who is interested in the Option Method. I cannot imagine what my life would be like had I not studied with Bruce Di Marsico many years ago. Thank you to Deborah Mendel for sharing his work in this wonderful book. Those ""Five Simple Questions"" really do work. They can help you to undo limiting beliefs that keep people locked in despair, anger, frustration, or any painful emotion.

B000OWNN7G,Entangled with A Texan: Texas Cattleman's Club,"Summary 1: David has a baby left on his doorstep and when he goes to the local department store to buy baby supplies, he meets shy-moussy Marissa who is dressed in a story book costume. David needs a nanny and thinks Marissa would be perfect,he offers her a lot of money and she takes the position. Soon David sees the sexy woman under the shy exterior and before long sparks are flying. Of course, his reputation as a womanizer doesn't help his suit. This is one of my favorites in the Texas Cattleman's series.
Summary 2: This book was the first in the series and it has gotten me hooked. I am going to read all five books and will enjoy everyone.
Summary 3: Another installment in the Texas Cattleman's Club series - Silhouette Desire #1547 (November 2003) - ""Entangled With A Texan"" by Sara Orwig. Book summary from back cover:Tied up in knots! How on earth had Texas Cattleman's Club member David Sorrenson been roped into protecting a tiny baby girl? The ex-military man knew everything about security and danger, not infants! Marissa Wilder was the perfect solution. This down-to-earth family gal knew all about children, and agreed to be a live-in nanny at his ranch. David yearned to show Marissa a steamy night or two, even though his high-risk lifestyle had taught him to avoid long-term attachments and his sexy houseguest deserved someone permanent. Living with Marissa was tangling up his emotions something awful, and if he didn't know better he'd swear he was falling for her...."
B0007J0QWQ,A sentimental journey through France and Italy,"Summary 1: Even for modern readers, ""A Sentimental Journey"" (published 1768)is as startlingly innovative as Sterne's celebrated ""Tristram Shandy"". Sterne's ability to crystallize the minute details of experience - which may be down to a few seconds only - is reminiscent of Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse"". Indeed, Woolf admired this book.This is by no means an easy read. The 18th-century prose is difficult; the book is larded with Frenchisms and Biblical or classical allusions; the complex, slow narrative often requires re-reading. But the rewards are great! It's wise, deeply comical, and incredibly perceptive.There are several helpful reviews below dealing with the aspect of ""sentimentality"", and so I will just single out two things which appealed to me:1. STERNE AND BODY LANGUAGE. Sterne shows an almost 20th-century appreciation of body language. In fact, I believe he might have been the first to identify it as such. His chapter, ""The Translation"", highlights the importance of being able to interpret subtle physical hints, like a language: ""There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of this _shorthand_, and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words."" How visionary!2. STERNE AND THE FRENCH. Ever since Shakespeare inserted a scene in ""cod French"" into _Henry V_, actually ever since the Norman Conquest and up to Monty Python and beyond, the English have revelled in mocking the French and their language. His Continental travelling gives Sterne the perfect excuse to do this. At one point he differentiates between ""tant pis"" (= ""never mind"" - where there is nothing to be gained) and ""tant mieux"" (= so much the better - where there IS an advantage). He also has a hilarious section on the grades of French swearing: first ""Diable!"", then ""Peste!"" and finally the words that he won't repeat. In all cases, Sterne carefully shows the social niceties of these expressions.The protagonist, Yorick, has various adventures of lust and feeling with women and other typically travelish things like losing his passport that we can all relate to. He's tender, obscene, learned, funny, companionable, and above all, readable - if tough.
Summary 2: A Sentimental Journey is a fabulous book for so many reasons. Laurence Sterne was an immensely influential writer in the 18th century--his major works, Sentimental Journey and Tristram Shandy, were responses to the travel narrative and newly born novel, respectively. His writing is essential to scholars of the 18th century--he is referenced in Austen's Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, Brown's The Power of Sympathy, Foster's The Coquette and Tyler's The Contrast. To understand and appreciate his novel is to have a better appreciation and love of the works that built their structures on his foundation. And yet it is original, as Yorick says himself, ""both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my fore-runners.""Yet it is not solely for historical benefit that one should read Sentimental Journey. The adventures and amours of Sterne's semi-autobiographical Yorick are delightful. One of the most romantic passages I've read in a book occurs when Yorick inadvertantly takes the hand of a woman and describes in detail the thrill of merely holding it. Granted, hers is not the only hand he will hold, but he writes so wonderfully, candidly and engagingly that it is extremely difficult to hold his passions against the sentimental Yorick. His scene with the starling locked in a cage is pertinent and a touching commentary on slavery. What a guy! My only complaint is the editor of this edition does not feel it necessary to translate the French-of which there is plenty-making some passages difficult to understand at best. However,this is a sentimental journey that I will gladly take over and over.
Summary 3: Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!
Summary 4: It's been a number of years since I read this short work for my Pre-1900s British Novels class as an undergraduate, and while my memory is a little fuzzy on the details, my general impression of dislike and boredom is crystal clear. While I'm sure there is complexity in the words, it's hard to overlook the basic fact that almost nothing happens in this first of the sentimental novels.However, I can readily admit that it's obviously at least somewhat preference given all the glowing reviews I have found. I like my books character driven. The kind of characters that I walk away feeling like I know them personally and am sad to part ways. While Yorick is the driving force, he lacked that depth.We followed it up with Evelina by Burney, which was far more enjoyable.
Summary 5: This book is a fun, light read.It's the kind of book you'd read while sunning out in the garden on a nice sunny summer day.I giggled quite a lot."

B000JDILVS,the mousewife,"Summary 1: A beloved treasure of early childhood, THE MOUSEWIFE has haunted me ever since I first read it. It is a deceptively simple tale of a house-bound mouse who befriends a caged dove. But the conversations between the two creatures and the juxtapositions of domestic tasks for the mouse with the longing for the wild of the dove takes on a touching comment on Romanticism. The idea for the story is to be found in Dorothy Wordsworth's journals of Grasmere, which she kept for the pleasure of her brother, the poet William. She, William and Coleridge enjoyed a creative community of writing, but the contributions of Dorothy to this effort are only recently being recognized in feminist studies. Certainly this little story with its themes of domestic security and an awakened sense of the sublime of nature reflects the dilemma of women writers in Romanticism. While in Dorothy's original story the dove dies, in this book the dove is released by the mousewife. I do believe it would be well worth it to publish this book again.
Summary 2: I have had this story for years in my class teaching of religion. It is a joyful story of freedom for the mouse and the dove.
Summary 3: ""A cage would never do for one made to fly..."", truer words have never been written! What a fantastic story about unforeseen friendship and bittersweet affection. The story is about a house-bound mouse who unexpectedly meets a caged dove. The mousewife is bored with her everyday routine caring for her mousehusband and has an appetite that cheese could never satisfy. She meets a dove who was captured and trapped. The dove's tales fill the mousewife with wonder and she is fascinated immediately. She learns about the world outside and aches for something more. Blue skies! Tall trees! Far horizons! I adored this story which offers a new perception on freedom, longing and love. Children and adults of all ages will embrace this story which can be read on many different levels and deem it a true classic.
Summary 4: Meet a special mousewife. She goes through the motions of doing her mousewifely duties but is just not satisfied with same old, same old. This mousewife, getting a glimpse at the world outside her realm (the confines of the house) ""want[s] more."" Finally, a remedy to her longing arrives in the form of a turtledove, caught by a boy and confined in a cage by the woman of the house. Longing for his freedom, the dove refuses to eat. But in his new habitat, he has an avid audience in the disillusioned mousewife, with whom he shares his stories of flying and the joys of the world outside. Eventually he falls for her, even greets her with dove-y endearments and kisses ""with his beak."" One night she puts her babies to sleep, then sneaks off to rendezvous with the bird. Upon the mousewife's return, her mad mate takes drastic action. Choosing family over fowl, she frees the bird and experiences an epiphany about the outside world sans turtledove, ""I can see for myself.""As an adult, I find this very short (ten minute read) story a bit intriguing, but as a picture book for four to eight year olds (its advertised target age) I don't. I can imagine (and have seen) the whole disillusionment issue going (expectedly) straight over the heads of these kids. My biggest beef with the book, however, is that the original author, Dorothy Wordsworth, gets almost no credit for her story! Shouldn't the cover say, ""by Dorothy Wordsworth, as retold by Rumer Godden""? I mean, where is the outrage? For this, I can't get beyond thinking the published version is just ""okay."" And unfortunately, I have not been able to find the original version to judge it on its own merits.As the mother of picture book readers, I believe that there are much more appropriate books for four to eight year olds: Frederick, Swimmy, Inch by Inch and The Biggest House in the World - all by Leo Lionni and Lily's Purple Plastic Purse and Chrysanthemum by Kevin Henkes, who writes neat books with mice as main characters.
Summary 5: Very good book. Quick read, good story and beautiful illustrations. Got this for myself to read, but am going to have my 9yr old read it as well."
0970490607,New Orleans Unleashed,"Summary 1: ""Rhonda Findley and I are the co-authors of New Orleans Unleashed. We created this book, along with the photographer, Vanessa Brown Louvier. There have been some postings giving me more credit than I'm due and suggesting that I was the sole author of the book, which is incorrect. I'd like to clarify that this was a group project. There were no stars, except for Indy the Dog. I hope you all enjoy our wonderful project.""
Summary 2: There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit,with the true author's approval however, for this book that John Demires actually entirely wrote. The book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of New Orleans' novel attractions.
Summary 3: This cute little book captures the wacky spirit of New Orleans with its dog's eye view. This is a perfect stocking stuffer or thank you gift for dog lover's everywhere. Great for kids too!
Summary 4: What a delightful tale! Indy Findley visits New Orleans' most famous attractions in this fun and frolicking tale of a precocious dog lost in the &quot;Big Easy.&quot; The tour of the city will be of interest to young and old alike.
Summary 5: WOW! After picking up a copy of this awesome book, I decided to buy a few more for my friends who are also dog enthusiasts. I thought that the pictures were brilliant and the story-line was very interesting. John DeMers did a great job writing it... Overall, GREAT BOOK!"
0880104422,Work and Play in Early Childhood,"Summary 1: The author does an ok job of giving highlights of the types of activities that go on in a Waldorf Kindergarten and the daily rhythm. But that's mostly what this book gives - highlights with not nearly enough description, details, or explanations. It's not that you'd waste your time reading the book (you can finish it in about an hour), but you might not feel you got your money's worth. You might want to try &quot;School as a Journey&quot; by Torin Fisner (about the same cost but nearly 3x the length!) which gives outstanding detail (including actual stories and poems told in class) and theories behind classroom instruction when he shares his teaching experience of his own Waldorf Classroom from Grade 1 through Grade 8.Bottom line - if you want a light introduction to Waldorf Kindergarten, this book is fine. But if you love details with the how's and why's, you'll be disappointed.
Summary 2: I read this short (78 pg.) and easy to read book to learn more about Waldorf education in general, specifically, the Kindergarten years (ages 3-7). This book begins with Rudolf Steiner's view of child development from birth through age 7. Not much explanation is given, sometimes just one or two sentences to give a reason for why something is done a certain way. The author quotes Steiner a few times but I felt there was not quite enough information given and I feel some of the theories behind the actions are a little wacky and go against proven science and biology. For example, Steiner is quoted as saying the internal organs are not shaped fully until age 7 and that every exposure to external environment (parents, school, TV, radio) affects and shapes the internal organs. I learned that Waldorf schools' Kindergarten is a mix of ages 3-7. An outline of what activities are done throughout the day is covered, story time with fairy tales, song time, outdoor play and games, etc., with explanations as to why those activities are done and why they are done in a certain order. Extremely briefly described is that Waldorf schools celebrate many different seasonal festivals and Christian festivals throughout the year, and are repeated every single year. Very brief mentioning of the different drawing with beeswax crayons, painting with watercolors, using very crude/not very formed toys out of natural materials (and why), knitting, embroidery, and woodworking. Explanation that the children are introduced to work such as cleaning, washing cloths with a washboard, and ironing. Also discussed is the general tone and environment of the class which is described as a &quot;protective mantle&quot;. I was disappointed that the topics were covered very briefly; I would have liked more detail. Seems like a big price for such a small and short book but it did give me a brief introduction to what the Waldorf Kindergarten schools are all about (no mentioning of what goes on in higher grades is written about here). I was left with wanting to know still more before I decide if Waldorf education is something that I want for my children. Currently I plan to homeschool and this book didn't give me much information on how to incorporate Waldorf principals into homeschooling, I guess I'll have to read &quot;Waldorf without Walls&quot; for that information. Lastly, I'd like to say I like the general activities that the children do in Kindergarten but just don't know if I agree with or know enough about Steiner's reasoning behind them, I will have to do more reading about Steiners' views before I can form that opinion.
Summary 3: As the other reviewers mentioned this is not the deep introduction to Waldorf Education parents might be looking for. But I consider it required reading for my assistants and co-teachers. Freyja Jaffke has an elegant way of describing the work that the teachers and children are doing. It is a constant inspiration to me, and I've had to replace my own book many times because I keep giving it away!If you are a teacher, this book is for YOU! Don't pass it up."
B000N755R8,The Good Priest's Son,"Summary 1: In THE GOOD PRIEST'S SON, Reynolds Price continues a theme that runs throughout his recent fiction: redemption based on some sort of repentance-- perhaps having to do with black characters-- by a middle-aged white sinner, usually male, i.e., prodigal son, whose roots are in North Carolina. The character here is Mabry Kincaid, who at 53 is staring down the barrel of a gun-- he is awaiting further tests to determine if he is in the early stages of multiple sclerosis. A restorer of old paintings, he is on a flight back to the United States from Paris when the twin towers of the World Trade Center are hit by the terrorists on September 11, 2001, and his plane is diverted to Nova Scotia. He then returns to his old home in North Carolina to visit his ailing father, a retired Episcopal priest whose live-in housekeeper is Audrey Thornton, an African American doctoral student in divinity at Duke University. She is also the mother of Marcus, a 19-year-old who has fathered at child at 17 with his cousin and has hopes of becoming a successful artist one day.The earmarks of Price's recent fiction are all here. A middle-aged Caucasian male apparently has just discovered that African Americans might be his equal. I suppose Mr. Price is to be commended for finally writing about sympathetic black characters. Both white Southern writers and readers certainly had to get to this place although other Southern artists were way ahead of Mr. Price. Carson Mccullers who over 60 years ago created memorable, decent black people in THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER as well as William Styron in THE CONFESSIONS OF NAT TURNER come to mind, just to name two. Mabry does much soul-searching and opines frequently about the cosmos. Some of his findings: men are base; men love nobody; men are sexually promiscuous; women are better; men have no friends; black people are better than white people, all other things being equal. Perhaps America on 9/11 was being paid back in part because of slavery. The contrast between whatever Mr. Price would call the North Carolina he writes about, whether rural or small town, and the rest of America. Then there is the religious overlay. The characters are usually pretty much main-line Protestant with a quirk here or there. Mabry, who has some residual religious feelings but not too many, is mildly repentant of his past life. He had many affairs while married but did see his wife through her final illness.Whether you care for Mr. Price's story or not, he certainly can spin one and obviously knows his territory. Remember when folks put peanuts in their Cokes and ceiling lights were often turned on with a string suspended from the bare bulb? What man hasn't checked, for instance, to make sure his pants are zipped up before he enters a room? And most of us have acquaintances we only regard as ""Christmas card"" friends.Price's characters sometimes stretch credibility. Some for instances: Mabry, who describes himself as not having one ""gay gene"" when the Australian Man Friday for a gay attorney who most assuredly was killed in he World Trade Center, thinks Mabry is making a pass at him, apparently has been totally comfortable from day one that his daughter is lesbian and is living with another woman. He is 53 and totally okay with that? Maybe. And, of course, the author's insistence on making saints out of his black characters although he does not go quite as overboard here as in his last novel, if I remember correctly. Marcus does have a child he's not supporting but then he's only 19. (There is a strange exchange between Marcus and Mabry when each person is to tell the other one ""sixty seconds' worth of some private business that eats him up"" They both relate stories of sexual excess. I suppose that shows that both black men and white men are roosters and equally red-blooded, equally decadent.) Finally, without giving away the ending, I'll point out that the priest's housekeeper has only worked for him for a month.As always Mr. Price's language is beautiful. I just wish I liked these characters more, particularly Mabry.
Summary 2: to start with,i'll admit i am more than a little prejudiced when it comes to the very talanted mr. reynolds price. his books as well as his characters are always compelling and are much anticipated by me, considering i read very few modern authors.what i like most of price's characters is though they are flawed,they have an obtainable redemption that they seem to either be chasing, or is chasing them. in this novel the character mabry is no exception. mabry is a man who is spending his time chasing the living ghosts who have comprised his life, and is coming to terms with each of them, but not always in the way he intends.this book is very well written, but as always when you read a novel by price, you also have to kind of breathe in the words as you go along, because as an author, mr. price has more to be said in his prose than most writers say. that is where the beauty of price's writings really shine.this book however moves very slowly, and i have seen a few reviews complaining about that. i believe the pacing in this book gives it a more meaningful quality. i believe that it is not just a book, but another fine piece of craftmanship that needs to be read by a large audience, like all of his works. for price is not only a fine novelist, but also a poet, commentator, religious scholar, essayist and playwrite.
Summary 3: Having some familiarity with the Episcopal Church, with the life and character of priests, and with the work of Reynolds Price (much admired by me in the past), I took up this novel with great interest and high expectations.I was sorely disappointed. Mr Price seems remarkably unfamiliar with Episcopal theology and practices--for example, when he's discussing Communion (Episcopalians believe in the Real Presence but don't confuse it with transubstantiation; they don't talk about ""pouring"" communion) and even the benefits of the Church Pension Fund. And where were this priest's bishop and other clergy?More importantly, the characters' speech is about the worst I've ever read. It's stilted, phoney, and completely unrealistic. Moreover, all the characters AND the narrator sound the same. And this novel takes Political Correctness to an absurd extreme. The main character, Mabry, not only speaks in a way that's at odds with how a 53-year-old white heterosexual male would talk; he's also one of the least-interesting, in fact off-putting characters in recent fiction. The only appealing character, Audrey (misprinted as Aubrey at one point), is sketched in two dimensions.This book seems hurriedly written. The review above is correct when it says that ""the major plot elements do not coalesce into a strong, single story."" That's for sure. I am not even sure that this piece, as composed, would have made a good short story; maybe.
Summary 4: A thoughtful perspective on America immediately post 911. If you enjoy Reynolds' other work, this is definitely worth reading."
014000033X,Anna of the Five Towns (Modern Classics),"Summary 1: Described by the prolific author as &quot;my serious novel,&quot; _Anna_ is the story of a young woman's struggles to free herself from the oppression of her domineering father. The title character is given a chance to live undreamed-of experiences when she inherits a fortune in properties and business ventures on her 21st birthday. Simultaneously, she finds herself the declared object of affection of one of the town's most desirable men. As her story unfolds, she is attracted to another man, more vulnerable, and must try to resolve many different demands on her sense of duty and her emotions.Set in the early 1900's, Bennett succeeds in evoking a strong sense of place with his fictionalized Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries. Critics have praised his full description of Methodism and Methodist church life of the time, as well. Bennett conveys sympathy for his protagonist and portrays the limitations placed on her for her gender without falling into condescension, concluding, &quot;She had sucked in with her mother's milk the profound truth that a woman's life is always a renunciation, greater or less.&quot;Anna's attempts to expand herself spiritually and personally, and to gain a sense of personal efficacy, make for an interesting read. However, Bennett violates flagrantly the old writer's adage, &quot;Show not tell,&quot; as when we are told repeatedly Anna's father is a miser and a tyrant long before we see him saying or doing anything miserly or tyrannical. Further, anyone looking for an intensely psychological novel with thoughts portrayed as stream of consciousness should be aware that Bennett's style descends from a Realist tradition.
Summary 2: When Anna turns 18, she inherits a large sum of money (and property) from her dead mother. Her miserly and cruel father discourages her from spending a penny of it and even forces her to extract high rents from her tenants. As if this weren't enough trouble, she falls in love with Harry Mynors who is only interested in her money. When she realizes this, she has become so used to this kind of treatment that she decides to marry him anyway. Naturalistic and depressing, Bennett portrays his main characters well. Poor Anna--you really feel for her by the end of the book.
Summary 3: Excellent. Arnold Bennett has such a wonderful way of capturing the way people think and speak - or rather as they thought and spoke 100 ago.I used to live in the Stoke on Trent area and am at home with the dialect words and phrases. Also with the area. Arnold Bennett uses slightly fictionalised names for the towns (Bursley instead of Burslem, for instance) and streets (Trafalgar Street instead of Waterloo Road) so anybody familiar with the area knows exactly where his characters live, where they tread.During my recent walk from SW France to NW England (Vic's Big Walk, followed by the book of the same nameVic's Big Walk)I walked the length of Trafalgar/Waterloo and also had a nostalgic mosey around Bursley/Burslem.Anna of the Five Towns is an enjoyable and informative read and also helped me to continue last year's experience."
B0008AYIGO,They Wrote on Clay: The Babylonian Tablets Speak Today,"Summary 1: Before the beginning of this century, the only information we had about Ancient Babylon was from the Bible. Consequently, most of the literature that I have read on the subject (written during the height of Iraqi Archeaology in the 1920's and 30's) has been on a religious note rather than a historical one. This book changed all that. It brought a highly academic subject to the layman. It is a simple, informative account of how the real Babylonians lived. It describes the Babylonians as an advanced people who appreciated art and literature, as well as entering into contracts and having mortgages. It is a great introduction to an ancient civilisation.
Summary 2: THEY WROTE ON CLAY : The Babylonian Tablets Speak Today. By Edward Chiera. Edited by George G. Cameron. 235 pp. Chicago and London : The University of Chicago Press, 1964 (1955). (pbk.)The civilizational achievements of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians only started to become known over the course of the last century or so. For our new understanding of the past we have to thank archaeology, in particular for its discovery of many tens of thousands of baked clay tablets which have miraculously preserved the complex cuneiform writing system, languages, and literatures of the ancient Mesopotamians, and for the patient decipherment of these tablets and other cuneiform-bearing artefacts by a small and dedicated group of international scholars.The literature on this subject today is vast, and much of it is accessible only to specialists. Of the studies that are generally available - such as those by A. Leo Oppenheim, Samuel Noah Kramer, and Thorkild Jacobsen - most tend to be aimed at a more scholarly type of audience, the kind of people who like detailed footnotes, precise references to sources, bibliographies, etc., and little seems to be available in the way of a more popular treatment for the general reader.This is where the present book comes in. Edward Chiera, though a competent and respected scholar, was exceptional in having an ardent desire to share his knowledge by making the results of his research readily and entertainingly available to the general reader. Consequently, instead of giving us, for example, a lengthy and detailed analysis of the religious ideas or political history of the Babylonians, he has chosen instead to offer an absorbing excursion into the common life of this ancient civilization.Chiera's 'They Wrote on Clay' is both well-written and easy to read since the pages are small, the font used is gratifyingly large and readable, and there are numerous black-and-white photographs and line drawings which illustrate various aspects of life in the near East : people, places, animals, domestic scenes, archaeological sites, buildings, artworks and other artefacts etc. These illustrations perfectly supplement Chiera's written account, and although many are contemporary, they do serve to suggest something of what life must have been like in the past.Chiera has managed to pack an awful lot into this small book. We learn about the discovery of the ancient cities, the amazing libraries of clay tablets that were unearthed, the exciting story of the decipherment of the complex cuneiform writing system, the worlds of business and religion, of kings, priests, scribes and ordinary folk, and of their multifarious doings, and of much else besides.The author clearly loved his subject, and it's invariably from such writers that we get the best books. So if you're looking for a well-written, well-illustrated, easy-to-read popular treatment of this fascinating world, a world that is vastly more important to you than you may realize since it is there and not in Greece that the real roots of Western civilization lie, you'd be hard put to better 'They Wrote on Clay.'And if Chiera succeeds in whetting your appetite, as I'm sure he will, you might go on to read one of the best-loved stories to come out of that world, the deeply moving story of the adventures of Gilgamesh, his friendship with the wild man Enkidu, and his search for immortality. I'm pretty sure that, if you don't already know it, you would very much enjoy that too. One good popular edition of this story that can be recommended is:THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH : An English Version with an Introduction by N. K. Sandars. Penguin Classics Revised Edition. 128 pp. London : Penguin, 1972 (1964) and Reissued.
Summary 3: I found this interesting book to be a very good source of translated inscriptions, some of which found their way into my own recent compilation ""Wetlands of Mass Destruction: Ancient Presage for Contemporary Ecocide in Southern Iraq"". From all the reference books I consulted for my writing project, this particular one was of a handful of those I found to be most useful in terms of the diversity of material presented."
0911019529,"Totline 123 Math: Pre-Math Activities for Working With Young Children (1-2-3 Series, Math: Ages 3-6)","Summary 1: I love this book for preschool math. I teach four years olds in a part time program and I will enjoy using the ideas in my preschool class room.
Summary 2: I am now a devoted Jean Warren fan! 1-2-3 Math is great for the under 5 set! I have two children, 4 and 2, and they both have gained so much from the easy activities in this book!
Summary 3: I have used this book and most of her others weekly if not daily in my family child care center. Her ideas are wonderful, the drawings are adorable and I own most of her books."
B000MV8HGG,The New England Table,"Summary 1: The New England Table shows us the bounty available in our oldest corner of the United States. With recipes demonstrating the harvest and traditions of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, all within New England, Lori Brody, whisks us away to delicious and appetizing meals.Lora Brody is a best-selling author with over 25 books to her credit. Her recipes have appeared in the Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune, just to name a few. She lives in Boston.The tantalizing photographs and the author's passion for her homeland, New England, can be seen throughout this book. With recipes like New England Clam Chowder, Nutmeg Cookies, Johnny Cake, Gorp, Maple-Pecan Scones and Blueberry Buckle to tease and tempt you.To make things easier, Brody divides the book up into the six states of New England. Each state features 3 events you could have utilizing the recipes within. The recipes demonstrate the ethnicity and bounty that is contained within each state.This is such a lovely book. I have enjoyed the recipes and Lora Brody has made me yearn to make a trip to New England and experience it in person!
Summary 2: This cookbook has wonderful Illustrations, great stories about New England, and every recipe I have tried is delicious. This is a worthwhile cookbook of American cooking and a must have in your collection. Really great seasonal and healthy recipes. Instructions are easy to follow. I enjoy the Tuna Noodle Casserole, no canned soup version.
Summary 3: The review by M. Holland is valid, however the food is glorious. I've made about half the recipes in this book and Brody really knows her stuff. The following recipes alone are worth every penny for the book: Boston Baked Beans, Indian Pudding and Indian Braised Lamb Shanks (using a from-scratch garam masala mix). There are various bread recipes (Johnny Cakes, Anadama, Hummus Bread, etc.) and chutneys that are wonderful.Many of her recipes tend to be light on the spice/seasoning. I simply double the amounts. For example, when I make Boston Baked Beans I double the amount of sage, ground ginger and dry mustard. Her salad dressings and vinaigrettes however, are perfect as-is and don't need tinkering.I have about 200 cookbooks and this one is probably in my top 20.
Summary 4: Kind of a lazy book; the title suggests a comprehensive reference, but what you get is a whatchagot stew of arbitary recipes & once-in-a-while Indian Pudding & Johnny Cakes.The number of Recipes-to-number-of-pages ratio is quite low, & plenty/most recipes not especially ""New England"" -- just because a salad calls for boston lettuce does not make it a regional specialty. Pimm's Cup? Asparagus salad with lemon vinaigrette? grilled chicken sandwiches with russian dressing? pear and candied ginger clafouti? tomato & goat cheese salad?There's one clam chowder recipe & it is an abomination. LIkewise her take on boiled dinner...a quarter cup of soy sauce? You have got to be kidding.Since when does Martha's Vineyard belong to Rhode Island?And is Connecticut actually part of New England? All of CT? Anything outside of an easy commute to NYC? More Yankees bumper stickers than Sox as a geographical demarkation?There are other New England cookbooks that are much, much better."
0954599306,Adventures of Well Being Now,"Summary 1: Nick Kemp has achieved something quite remarkable with this CD. By mixing skilfully crafted music, and in language that everyone can follow, he carefully guides the listener through many of the concepts of meditation. But more than this the CD gives anyone the chance to experience some of the altered states of consciousness that meditation promises. The music may remind you at times of ""Revolver"", while the opening tamboura-like drone, and tabla, point to the source, Nada Brahma - Sound Is God. Truth seekers and sceptics alike will find flashes of insight here that might lead to further exploration, which I guess is what Nick Kemp has set out to encourage. Highly recommended.
Summary 2: This is a wonderful CD from Nick Kemp who studied with Richard Bandler the creator of NLP.The CD takes the listener on a magical ride into deep relaxation and altered states and produces a great sense of well being. The music is fantastic and the intricate use of hypnosis makes this an important product for students of NLP and hypnosis.
Summary 3: This is a fascinating CD which takes the listener into deep relaxed states in no time at all. I find that by listenibg to this CD I feel more energised and focussed! The only downside is that you have to wait a number of weeks here for it to be posted, but its worth the wait!
Summary 4: First, I think I'll mention Richard Bandler's name so as to give credence to my comments. On second thought, no, I won't either.Having settled that, I can tell you that Nick really knows how to weave a trance that will keep you spellbound as you begin an inner adventure that will take you places you've never even dreamed of ... and yet ... will bring you safely home again. To your own, true self.Nick is a master of both indirect and direct hypnotic suggestion, yet even as he gives you direct instructions, you still know ... at the same time ... that the direct suggestions in here are just to set you free.Free from fear. Free from compulsion. Free from pain.I've listened to the CD twice so far and I'm here to tell you that after the first listening, only, I discovered I had recovered my old sense of confidence.And now. Now that I have that sense of confidence instilled deep within me ... never to be wrested away again, I can only wonder what I might decide to do with ... and because of ... it.If you, like me, don't easily experience deep trance ... I'd suggest you give this CD a listen. It's well worth your time!"
B000QB8IFM,Wren,"Summary 1: If someone can get their hands on this Book, Wren, I highlyrecommend it for children and parents who have a sibling withcerebral palsy. It will teach young children that anyone witha disability can do anything if they have their mind set to it.Almost everyone I knew read Wren when I was growing up.I read it because it helped me understand my own cerebral palsy.Thanks
Summary 2: i HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WREN WAS ONE OF MY FIRST lOVES I HAVE CP AND IT HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND MY OWN CP.UNLESS YOU KNOW THE TIME-FRAME IN WHICH THIS WAS WRITTEN,YOU CAN NOT UNDERSDTAND HOW HER MOTHER FELT. I LIKED IT
Summary 3: I think what some people who gave this book negative reviews aren't getting is that this book is for children, not adults which is the reason it might seem to ""talk down"" as one reviewer said. I read this book many years ago in 3rd or 4th grade and since I was a child, I did enjoy it. This children's book was also influenced me to read both ""Karen"" and ""With Love from Karen"" some years years later. Both of these books were written for teens and adults and as a teenager, I enjoyed both these books as well.Someone else suggested that parts of the story were insulting because of the manner in which certain terminology was used. I think some readers are not aware ORIGINAL book was published in a much earlier time (late 1940s or very early 50s, I believe) at a time before awareness of how politically incorrect statements can, and ARE hurtful. However, I am not sure the author is living anymore to make the editorial changes in order to keep up with the more enlightened readers of today. Marie Killilea was an adult and Karen was already older than I when I read the book as a child.In order to enjoy this book, it has to be taken for what it is, a CHILDREN'S book written many years ago and, therefore, rather dated as compared to children's books of these times.I gave the book only 3 stars because it has been many years since I read it. However, I feel that since it was the reason for reading the other 2 books about Karen when I was a teenager in the 60s, it deserves at least this many.
Summary 4: I read Karen & From Karen With Love when I was a young girl. I just fell in love with Karen and have never been able to forget her story. I have scoliosis and had polio, just a light case as a child and - to read a story about a girl that was around my age and managed just fine with her disability gave me reasons to hope when I felt low. I loved the way Marie wrote....I've looked for this book for years and now I've found it...I'll go back in time for a bit and say hello again to an old and dear friend. It's definitely worth your read. Anna
Summary 5: Mary Powers wrote an eloquent review of how distasteful this book really is. It talks down to its readers. I also did not like the way the author refers to herself as &quot;Mom Pom.&quot; It is one thing if the children called her that, but for a competent adult to refer to herself that way is ludicrous. The book reads like a little homespun saga, but in real life nobody is that loving and 100% self sacrificing. Even the &quot;nice appearance&quot; is a facade. I didn't like the fact that the rabbit was named &quot;little black sambo,&quot; which I felt was a racist slur. I also did not like the way Karen was portrayed as a 100% cheerful, uncomplaining little martyr. She wasn't. She was a bright, delightful, adorable little girl who had a physical challenge and who learned to cope with it. She got tired. She was ashamed of the &quot;ugly, yellow leather stains&quot; the braces left on her legs. She regularly saw her older sister Marie get relegated to the background while their foster sister stole the limelight in the books and in their mother's eyes. Wren is stupidly written and makes light of how serious an effort physical therapy is. Calling Karen's hard work &quot;games&quot; is insulting at best, misleading at worst. Wren really is for the birds!"
0007101929,Seahenge: A Quest for Life and Death in Bronze Age Britain,"Summary 1: First the negative, minor though it might be. The book is really rather misnamed. If anything, while Seahenge is a captivating title, it is way too limited. While the author discusses the wood circle at Holmes, he does so only briefly in the introduction and over a couple of chapters at the end of the book. What the main body of the volume contains is a very pleasant recitation of a life spent working in Neolithic and Early Bronze age archaeology in England.For those looking for a more thorough description of the work and story of the remains at Holmes, it would probably be better to look to the journals. A visit to the local reference library for a bibliography will probably come up with what you want, and large public and certainly most university libraries will carry many of the journal entries on your list. These are likely to be quite technical, though, so be forewarned. More popular accounts might be available in journals like Archaeology, Archaeology Odyssey, or Scientific American.Next, the positives. And they are major positives. First and foremost, the author has a very nice narrative style. It's readable and friendly, and while laced with some technical terms and ideas, these are usually fully explained without being labored. Furthermore, the author shares his knowledge of his field in practice so the reader has a first person, first hand account of an archaeologist at work. At one point Dr. Pryor quotes from his site diary, letting one in on his personal thoughts and experiences at a crucial point of his work at Seahenge.Probably more than anything, the book offers a glimpse of what it means to be an archaeologist. In particular the reader learns how one goes about acquiring ones credentials, what the management of daily routine on the site is like, under what conditions one works and lives, what job opportunities there are, and how these effect ones personal lifestyle.If one is inclined to follow up the information on archaeology and the archaeologist, the bibliography provides a good deal of material, some on specific topics from the journals and some on more general topics from books, most from 1980 to the present and some of historical interest from the 1960s and later.I would definitely recommend this book for a school library serving students from forth grade and later. The book would be comprehendible to good readers of whatever age and gives a clear account of an archaeologist's life and what one has to learn to become one.
Summary 2: The author has a wonderful style that combines a hands-on experience with digging up Neolithic and Bronze Age sites with relections on the human understanding of landscapes in the prehistoric world. Lots of local color and opinions enhance the read. I will read more from this author.
Summary 3: More of a book on the life of an archeologist than the discoveries themselves it nevertheless makes for an interesting read. I think many will be surprised, as I was, at the various facet involved in the life of an archeologist. In that way is it is a very generous book. A tale worth telling."
B000IOF13E,Casey at the Bat,"Summary 1: Having a son named Casey, I have many copies of ""Casey at the Bat"". Each and every one of them has Cooney and Burrows die at first. The new Harper Collins edition reads..""And then when Cooney died at second, and Burrows did the same..."" Not only does this interrupt the meter of the poem, it doesn't make any baseball sense. Mudville is losing by two runs in the bottom of the ninth. When Cooney gets up there are no outs. How does he die at second? How does Burrows do the same? Did they try to stretch a single into a double? I can just see the veins popping out on the managers forehead when they pulled that stunt. This line is really something to think about and I am wondering where the editors at Harper Collins came across it.The illustrations by Leroy Neiman are wonderful. Here you see a very Mantlesque looking Casey straining every muscle to connect with that pitch and end the game with a towering blast. I also loved the fact that they are not in color. The only disturbing part is that before the final verse of the poem, you are clearly shown that Casey has missed the ball. Now we all know that Casey struck out, but you don't want to know that until the text tells you. To this day I always hope that air which is shatterd has been the result of his hitting the ball. The placement of Mr Neiman's illustrations takes that hope away. If I had been reading this to my son for the first time, he would surely have seen that the mighty Casey had failed. There would have been no need to read the last stanza. I certainly do not recommend this as a childs first introduction to this poem. The format and illustrations are wonderful, but save it for your second purchase!
Summary 2: What do you get when you combine Ernest Thayer's beloved, boys of summer poem and artist, Leroy Neiman's rich, charcoal illustrations? A unique and evocative rendering of Americana that adds an additional rare gem to the rich collection of Casey At The Bat books. Mr Neiman's unique, expressive, and dynamic artwork brings the poem to life in all its emotional splendor and glory. From the introduction by New York Yankee's manager, Joe Torre, to the very last page, as muscular Casey, bat in hand, hangs his head and takes that lonely walk from the plate into fictional history, young and old alike will be entranced by this powerful and engaging, larger than life story. Perfect for youngsters 8 and older, Leroy Neiman's, oversized, coffee table-like Casey At The Bat is a combination of verse and artwork at its finest, and a must for both baseball fans and art lovers everywhere.
Summary 3: One of the book covers was torn and covered with a black substance. It was unsuitable to gift to the intended recipient. I had to obtain another book locally. I tried to contact Horizon Books via telephone, but never got an answer. I would appreciate a replacement copy!
Summary 4: In my opinion, it is a healthy thing to modernize the classic baseball poem ""Casey at the Bat."" Written over a century ago, it is still an excellent description of a wonderful game. In this book, Neiman uses some superb sketches that depict the players of today. Names and numbers are on the backs of the uniforms, Casey wears a batting helmet, the fans are wearing modern clothing and Casey looks like a slugger. Depicted as a muscular behemoth, his arms look like he could crush the life out of a bear.Reading ""Casey at the Bat"" is a delight in any form and I highly recommend this one.
Summary 5: Ernest Lawrence Thayer's classic baseball poem about the small town of Mudville and its beloved baseball hero is superbly enhanced with LeRoy Neiman's charcoal drawings in this illustrated coffee table book. This splendid edition of Casey At The Bat is enhanced with an introduction by Yankees manager Joe Torre and filled with soulful, blending of Thayer's words and Neiman's illustrations blending together to bring the spirit of this memorable and beloved poem to life. Casey At The Bat is to be treasured by all baseball buffs, and heartily recommended for school and community library collections."

Summary 2: This is a very beautiful book - beautiful in itself and the PRS guitars showcased here. The photographs are large and clear. The PRS models are comprehensive. The quality of the book is very good. It's large-sized and it's thread bound in the spine. Unlike those bound with heat glue, this book will surely last. According to the publisher's information, it's a limited edition in quantities of 6000 only. This is a book that a PRS guitar owner should consider buying. For those who admire the workmanship and the beauty of quality guitars, this is a very good book to read. Shortcomings: the photos are up to a professional standard, but many of them are accompanied with a white bar in the upper body of the guitar due to shinny reflection. This effect can illustrate how shinny the guitar can be, but can be quite obstructive to the eyes. A final word of caution: Beware of the temptation that one would buy a PRS guitar right after reading this book - which can be far more expensive than the book itself!
Summary 3: This numbered limited edition may not reach all audiences but it provides an excellent survey of the PRS guitar built by Smith for a range of famous players. Gorgeous full-page color photos abound as do engrossing technical explanations of the guitar's development and history. Chapters covering construction techniques are particularly involving. Highly recommended: any avid guitar player who appreciates books on guitar making should have this keepsake edition, enclosed in a handsome slipcase.

1892975831,"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","Summary 1: I bought this book prior to a trip to Italy with my 3-year-old son and was highly disappointed. The authors stick to only the most obvious siteseeing destinations and didn't provide the nitty gritty that a traveler with children really needs. For example, the chaper on Venice of course describes St. Marks, but makes no mention of the playground right near the train station. The Milan chapter mentions &quot;The Last Supper&quot; but overlooks a park we discovered that has a collection of dinosaur statues and a carousel.Another major omission: the authors made no mention of the fact that many youth hostels offer accommodations for families, and the YH in Verona was a real gem -- gorgeous grounds to run around on, a spacious room, and cheap meals. It was also about one block away from a playground. None of the accommodations listings mention the hostel option.Bring Lonely Planet and leave this book behind -- the luggage space is better used by a spare coloring book or toy.
Summary 2: As other reviews have stated, this book is far from perfect. But I bought it as soon as I read the art-gallery hint (take crayons and paper). We just got back from a Picasso museum, and our 6-year-old was begging for freedom even though she learned about Picasso in kindergarten. The crayons would have been a lifesaver.On the upside, the authors understand what kids like and need, and give good hints on things they will like. On the downside, they don't seem to be the brightest bulbs on the planet (the book is filled with howlers like ""wet your appetite"" and ""taxi cues""). They also seem to have a heck of a lot more money than I do (and I'm far from poor). Their idea of an inexpensive hotel is 95 Euros a night for a double (and the kids are extra!). That's my idea of splurging. I shudder every time they tell me that a particular cafe is ""a bit pricey, but a good place to relax"". I translate that to ""lunch will cost more than you ought to be spending on a room.""The second edition also suffers from sloppy proofreading. There are lots of places where prices are still given in lira. The Euro has been around long enough now that I have no clue what 5,000 lira would equate to.Even so, I'm glad I bought the book. I'll be able to sit down with my daughter and plan the trip together, and that alone is worth the price.
Summary 3: So far we have found this book helpful in planning our trip. It seems most useful for the larger cities.We especially like the section with the specific kid phrases to translate.However, we have found that we are still going online to get additional information. We really like www.ciaobambino.com for child friendly accommodations and have used www.itravelitalia.com to help plan our trip which has provided trip specific info for our needs.Overall, I would say it has been an average book in planning our trip.
Summary 4: I was very disappointed with this book. I took 2 books it was ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL I turned to and it is the one my kids enjoyed the most. Pat had great insight about how to make your kids part of the experience, they will always remember this trip as with ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL they were part of the decisions.
Summary 5: There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in Italy that would appeal to a child under the age of 12. This book is a waste of money. If your kids are under 12, take them to Disneyland/World and save yourself a lot of money and whining."
1593303483,Life: Enjoy The Ride,"Summary 1: I enjoyed Life: Enjoy the Ride. The book presented deep insight in to life in a way that is accessible at any level, from children to adult.
Summary 2: What a great job done by Dr. Monday! It is a go with the flow book and acceptance of what life brings you. It looks like it could be helpful for both adults and children to handle the stresses of life. I could imagine children going through a life-changing situation, such as separation, divorce or death of a family member learning from this book.
Summary 3: In just a few pages, important life lessons are taught by an adorable little turtle. Turtle especially reminds us to enjoy the present moment and not live in fear of the future.This book should be read again and again by adults and children.I will definitely share this treasure of a book with my family and friends."
B0007EH5IY,"The adventures of Big-Foot Wallace,: The Texas ranger and hunter","Summary 1: I like reading about the Old West in the 1800s. Time Life books has reprinted a great group of leather bound Old West Classics ( see my reviews).John C. Duval 1870 wrote a classic true story about Big Foot Wallace, a 6ft 4in Texas frontiersman, Indian fighter, ranger and soldier against Mexico.The 291 page book reads well with no boring parts. Some B/W illustrations too. I'm glad Duval left out the slang and misspellings of frontier English and used a normal modern English.We see Big Foot Wallace originally from Virginia living in Texas. We see him as a level headed frontiersman who hunted deer, turkeys and bear and honey. We see his escapades with rattlesnakes and tarantulas. Wallace did have a sense of humor. Parts of the book are funny.Then we see him as an Indian hunter who really wanted to be left alone by the Indians but if his possessions were stolen or if threatened would fight and kill them with a vengeance. We see him captured by Indians and living as an adopted ""son"" by an old squaw and later helped to escape by her other son.Later we see Big Foot Wallace as a ranger and a soldier against Mexico. He is captured and some men are sentenced to be executed by Santa Anna. They draw black and white beans. If black they are killed. Luckily Wallace draws a white bean and after a few years as a prisoner is released.We see him in New Orleans getting used to city life. Then he gets news he is to report to Virginia to get part of an inheritance.Later he tries his hand at farming on 200 acres he bought and built a small ranch house. He hates farming.I won't ruin the ending for you.Here is a good book showing true stories of Texas frontier life, Indian fighting and soldering against Mexico and much more. An interesting classic. Anyone interested in the Old West will like this book. 4 stars.
Summary 2: Interesting Texas stories told with a twang that rings true. Bigfoot was pure macho. He came to Texas to kill the man who killed a family member of his, and ended up killing many men who were trying their dang-dist to kill him.
Summary 3: If Big Foot Wallace actually experienced these events he was a great frontiersman, Or was he a great storyteller? Everyone interested in western history will enjoy this book."
1564145115,"Electronic Resumes & Online Marketing,: Second Edition (Electronic Resumes & Online Networking)","Summary 1: Rebecca Smith's work on Electronic Resume's and Online Networking is a must read.

1860230628,Racing the Moon,"Summary 1: I read this book in one sitting on a train journey, and couldn't put it down. It was utterly captivating, and I love the characters of Alex and Darcy.The way in which Alex and Darcy meet - the teenage Darcy has to correspond with an American academic because her school has asked her to take part in the US university's reseach project - is ingenious, and the letters between the dry and dusty researcher and the teenager are hilarious. Prone makes much fun out of Darcy piercing the pomposity of this guy she knows only by initials.As Darcy grows up, she sees Alex much more as a friend, but because of the rules of the research they must never meet or exchange any identifying information. This is both fascinating and intriguing as an examination of what makes friendships, and whether it is possible to have as a close friend someone you have never met.The other characters and events in Darcy's life are also very well portrayed, as a study in growing up; Prone makes excellent use of her knowledge both of the US and of Ireland.The denouement is sheer brilliance. My only regret is that I felt the book finished too soon.
Summary 2: Quite frankly this is my favorite book. I enjoy reading, and I've read a lot of books, but over the past 5 years since I read this, it's still my favorite, I've read it several times.
Summary 3: Racing the Moon (I still can't figure out the reason for this title) is a book about two Irish fraternal twin sisters, Sophia and Darcy. From a very young age, Sophia is established as the prettier one, the more competent one, the more likeable one, while the overweight Darcy--who in reality is just as smart and competent as her sister--fades into the background. Their parents dote on Sophia, from her desire to become fluent in the Irish language to her long-range career plans, while their father in particular despairs of Darcy's choices in life.Yet it is Darcy who is the star of the novel. Her wit and intelligence are showcased through her long-term correspondence with an American graduate student as part of a longitudinal study on relationships. Although Darcy and her ersatz pen pal, Alex, can never meet, much of Darcy's life unfolds via her increasingly detailed letters to her confidante. Darcy does have other relationships, from the ever-developing, complex relationship with her twin to a near-miss love affair, but it is in her letters, faxes, and emails to Alex that we get to know her best. Although the majority of the book is narrated from Darcy's perspective, occasionally, there is a shift to Sophia's point of view, which is a bit unnerving but probably necessary to provide the requisite insight into her character (in a few instances, the perspective of the twins' mother is featured as well).The main action of the novel follows the twins from their teenaged years until their late 20s; family, career, and romance all factor into their individual development. The end of the book contains such a surprise that only the most astute of readers is likely to pick up the subtle clues which precede it. Although this certainly adds interest to the story, it also brings it to a fairly abrupt halt, leaving many questions unanswered. Yet I believe that most readers will not be disappointed, as they will have enjoyed the ride and gotten to know the characters enough to supply their own answers.
Summary 4: Darcy and Sophia King are non-identical twins born in Dublin, in a very normal family. Their father Robert is a pathologist at a local medical centre, and their mother Colette lives through her love for her husband.The novel focuses on the evolution of this family during one generation, seen through the eyes of Darcy, a young rebel who suffers from being the twin of a perfect girl loved by her parents, her teachers and her peers. Darcy feels so far from a perfection she tends to despise that her relationship to her sister develops in a mixture of sisterly love and sometimes heinous jealousy.Their differences increase as the chapters go by.Sophia (pretty, polite and discreet), reveals a vulnerable side that she hides under the appearance of a woman who perfectly controls her life. From unhappy experiences to success, she admits that she's rarely physically alone but that she lives in an emotional loneliness against which she can't struggle. Darcy invariably fights weight problems and suffers from only being ""Sophia's sister"". It is only through separation caused by Darcy's international carrier that the two sisters finally get closer.Although one can't talk about an epistolary book, the story centres around the correspondence between Darcy and an American sociologist, Alexander Carbine Brookstone, who's thirteen years older than she is. Despite the age difference, their relationship evolves into genuine friendship, and Darcy takes refuge in the letters, faxes and, later on, emails that she exchanges with him. Her rebellion, her lack of confidence, her relationship to her sister, to her parents, to her boyfriend, and her frustration regarding her weight explode in this correspondence. Reassured by the idea that she will never meet Alex, she confides her most secret emotions and her thoughts about the world around her, in a way that is alternatively tender, defiant and hilarious.The biggest quality of this enthralling novel is a confident writing style and a quick pace which doesn't leave room for boredom. It gives life to the characters in a completely exceptional way. The relationships between the protagonists are amazingly real, and page after page, their evolution manifests itself very naturally, whether it's through Darcy's letters to Alex or through Sophia's diary. Terry Prone has masterfully succeeded in making each sentence a fascinating discovery -- even the (side-splitting) description of Darcy's fridge contents is enchanting. This book depicts complex characters and carefully avoids stereotypes and shortcuts. Identifying with Darcy is extremely easy, not because she's an empty shell in which anyone could fit (Darcy is anything but an empty shell!), but because Racing the Moon pulls the reader into her life and -- a rare phenomenon in literature -- makes one forget that she's a fictional character. Darcy is the woman next door, she's someone you pass on the street every day, she's that girl sitting at the back of the room. To everyone, she's quite mundane. In truth, she's exceptional.A must-read!"
0915138271,"Samaritan Documents Relating to Their History, Religion and Life (Pittsburgh Original Texts and Translations Series No. 2)","Summary 1: First, I must say that finding books that actually give the Samaritan perspective about their community free of outside interpretations is difficult. That being said John Bowman's book is one of a few that actually allows the perspective to speak for itself. The book a treasure since it translates the Samaritan equivalent of Midrash, Talmudic type texts, Hagaddic, etc. This book alone is good in understanding the Samaritans from their very own texts. It must be noted that the version that I have at least is type set with a type writer type script, but don't let that hold you back from acquiring this book if you are interested in Samaritan traditional understanding. The only criticism of the book I can offer is that I wish there had been more information from the Samaritan legal perspective (halakhah). All, and all I consider this one of the best finds I have on Samaritan history.
Summary 2: This book is a must buy! John Bowman was professor of Department of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Melbourne, Australia. The book is a total of 370 pages long. It is divided into 5 chapters. It beginns with the Samaritan Bible as he calls it. Next is the translation of the Chronicles of the Samaritans which is had to find out side of this book. Chapter 3 is Biblical Commentraies of the Samaritans. Chapter 4 is Haggadic Midrash which is their beliefs. Five is the Halakah codes or rules including Marriage, circumcision etc. In the Epilgue at the end is four prayers translated from the Samaritan Liturgy. At the back is an index with an index of Biblical and post-biblical references. This book also has a short Bibliography. The author has given footnotes at the end of each section. This book you can not refuse to buy. It is well under priced for the information that it has. Buy it and enjoy!
Summary 3: This book finally reveals the Samaritans in their own words, an important and worthwhile endeavor. For a long time this was a people that was forgotten, like the Armenians. However in the 2-5th centuries A.D they made up half or more of the population of the Holy Land. A semi-Jewish people practicing a form of Judaism lived and worshipped in these centuries until they were destroying in a series of rebellions against Christian Byzantium and perseucted under Absassid Islam. A fascinating religion and people, these importatn texts explain their way of life and traditions and keep them with us.Seth J. Frantzman"
1573927643,Tipping the Scales of Justice: Fighting Weight Based Discrimination,"Summary 1: The quiet, measured, dignified prose style of the author, a sort of removed reportage, makes the horrors of discrimination in education, health-care, social life, employment, the world of entertainment, and so forth all the more starkly ugly, cruel, dangerous, and damaging. The damage, however, is not confined to those fat people who are so viciously discriminated against. It extends to almost everyone who is infected with fear and hatred of fat, everyone who would rather be blind or deaf or lose a limb than be fat, everyone who succombs to the blandishments of a greedy, fear-mongering, prejudice-supporing bariatric industry. In other words, we're all in this together and we've all got to get out of it together. And the legal considerations Solovay brings to our attention, the suggestions she makes about extending legal coverages against discrimination already in place, and the compassion she displays for victims make this book one of the important beginnings for recovery from anti-fat hysteria. Thank you for this book.
Summary 2: In perhaps the first and only authoritative book on fat prejudice, attorney Sondra Solovay paints a disturbing picture of widespread mistreatment of the obese and urges extension of current law to remedy these problems. Proclaiming ""fat discrimination"" as the civil rights issue of the millennium, she calls for increased legal protection, detailing a litany of abuse afflicted on fat people by peers, teachers, employers, and even judges. She disputes the prevailing notion that fat people's size is their own fault, saying scientific evidence shows that obesity is not within the individual's control. Because body size may be immutable and not reflective of a person's abilities, she argues that anti-discrimination law should apply. She touts progress against fat discrimination, including laws passed in Michigan and California that specifically prohibit discrimination on the basis of weight in employment and housing.The author recommends applying disability laws to the obese, a controversial stance which puts her at odds with other so-called fat-rights advocates who resist using the disabled label. After examining several cases involving the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, she concludes that the courts' treatment of larger-sized people under these laws too often is inconsistent, confused, and tainted by fat prejudice. She proposes a clearer, more logical way of categorizing and analyzing these cases, and reiterates how de-stigmatizing obesity helps correct pervasive misperceptions of fat people's abilities.The book's strength lies in its focus on education and reform and the human face put on the problem of fat prejudice. However, even the author's extensive use of footnotes can't compensate for the dearth of legal materials involving weight discrimination. The appendices list organizations devoted to fat-rights advocacy, recommended readings, samples of anti-discrimination laws and excerpts from the ADA. But the paucity of published opinions reflects the reason why the book is a ""tool of legal scholarship"" as opposed to a ""handbook"" -- the still novel issue remains largely confined to academia and talks shows, not the actual practice of law. In our progressively heavier society, fat people may be closer to tipping the scales as the majority, but one wonders whether protection against fat prejudice will ever become the prevailing legal norm.
Summary 3: This is a great book if you are researching (or just interested in) issues of size acceptance advocacy or gender justice issues.
Summary 4: This book is very helpful and has been cited by numerous authors.Great book!"
1929355025,"If You Were with Me, Everything Would Be All Right","Summary 1: Ken Harvey's stories have appeared in numerous literary journals. If You Were With Me Everything Would Be All Right, his first book, collects a baker's dozen. Every story is a polished gem sparkling with insight into ordinary people's extraordinary lives. With quiet dignity lonely characters struggle with the human condition in a world where comic relief is dark, bizarre, and inscrutable.Harvey, winner of this year's Violet Quill Award, read ""Mr. Bubble, I Love You"" at the award ceremony. In it, twelve year-old Ho focuses his nascent homosexuality upon a gentle, meticulous older man he nicknames Mr. Bubble, who ""always smiled and smelled of soap"" at his session with Ho's therapist mother. But Mr. Bubble's attentions are only polite indulgences of a child, Ho learns sadly, when he spies Mr. Bubble at lunch doting on his girlfriend.Most of the stories are set in Lynn, Massachusetts, and each main character appears to fit into family and community. Privately, though, all feel abandoned--disconnected from the very relationships in which they yearn for comfort. In the title story, pragmatic Owen and romantic Arthur are at odds in their long-term relationship, each awkwardly trying to reach the other but floundering, ""where nothing seems young, not you, not love, not even death."" Theo (""33 1/3""), whose wacky family celebrates RPM anniversaries, will soon be 33 1/3-and feels unmoored by his lover's indifference. Uncle Vincent (""Mariposa"") envies young Joey, who easily chooses gender reassignment while Vincent, who came out at 40, feels ""he was given a credit card without a spending limit, but the only store he could shop in had just had major liquidation sales"" and he had to settle for what was left. Kevin (""Tipping Cows"") wants to love his deviant father who seemed ""born without a gene that gave you the ability to love."" And in ""The Near Occasion"" Andrew, himself gay, tries unsuccessfully upon his mother's death to re-connect with the father who abandoned them for another man, and thinks, ""I began the day burying one parent and am ending it burying another.""Ken Harvey wastes no words, and with leavening humor, fluent dialog, brilliant figurative language, believably bizarre situations, and living characters makes his stories swell the heart long after their reading. His is the art of the short story at its very best.
Summary 2: This book of stories walks that incredibly fine line between laughing and crying. Knowing you shouldn't laugh at others' misfortune, you are nonetheless unable to hold back. Mr. Harvey has found a way to see the humor in the everyday lives of the displaced; each new tale brings further understanding. By all means, find a warm corner of the porch and settle in for a wonderful read.
Summary 3: Ken Harvey's book, IF YOU WERE WITH ME, EVERYTHING WOULD BE ALL RIGHT, is not to be missed. Each story is an entity onto itself. I had to pause between each to digest the layers and the characters. They are haunting. Ken is brilliant in his portrayal of what makes us human. He captures the essence of childhood, love and pain. The stories work together beautifully. Where is this man's novel?? Do not hesitate--go buy this book!
Summary 4: This is not what my life has been like, yet it is exactly what my life has been like. And isn't that the definition of great writing: making you think ""I've been through that"" while narrating a set of specifics that may differ wildly, making you feel the warmth of identification while describing painful, even horrific, details? And Ken Harvey is fabulous with the details - exactly right, exactly specific, triggering powerful emotion, opening new worlds for you to understand and believe in, even if you have not had the precise experience. Suddenly, having had the precise experience or not becomes completely beside the point.Now that Harvey has also written his memoir, ""A Passionate Engagement"" - also hugely recommended, can we start a campaign to demand a novel from this man? It would be a landmark, I am sure.
Summary 5: the book explores homosexuality, gender, and transgender themes (among others).for those of us whose lives already include queer issues, it is refreshing to look beyond their socio-political context, and just enjoy a good book.those who are new to queer culture are exposed to its humanity with an accesable writing style."
B000FPWSZK,The Knight Of The Swords (the First Book Of Corum) (The first book of corum),"Summary 1: This book is the first of the Swords Trilogy, part of the Chronicles of Corum, which in turn is part of the Eternal Champions cycle (Michael Moorcock is very prolific!).The book follows the adventures of Prince Corum, who seeks vengance on those who murdered his family, and destroyed his race, the Vadagh. He finds that his quest is part of a greater struggle; between Law and Chaos, and that mortals are just the pawns of the gods. Along the way, he makes a bargain with a sorcerer, finds true love and confronts the ruler of the first five plane: The Knight of Swords.Not bad as swords and sorceries go, but the pace is very rushed. Better than Moorcock's Sci-fi stuff though...
Summary 2: This book is what good fantasy is all about. Moorcock's imagination is unlimited, and he has created a huge world in which to set his characters. The depth of his writing is quite admirable.'The Knight of the Swords' tells of Prince Corum, who is the last living member of his race. He suffers from a burning desire for vengeance on those who killed his family, and his adventures are fraught with danger and more importantly, meaning.Moorcock is an exceptionally intelligent author, and he juggles the concepts of good and evil with ease, weaving them into a dazzling and complex tapestry. His style of writing might be seen as slightly archaic, but the story is ever-changing, and dynamic enough to capture the reader's interest and hold it.
Summary 3: Moorcock notes that this is one of the only times he used a historical type of setting for a series, because he was stuck with a not so good Cornish-English dictionary, partly.Corum Jhaelen Irsei, the Prince in the Scarlet Robe, is one of the last of the Vhadhagh, a race that is a precursor to the Mabden, or man.The Lords of Chaos are not too pleased with Corum, as he is siding with the men, which could do bad things to their power base. You would not expect any less from The Eternal Champion, though."
0635016524,"The Mystery of the Alamo Ghost (Real Kids, Real Places)","Summary 1: I have a ten year old son who is homeschooled. It was his love of this book on which I'm basing my five star rating. Recently we read this book as a read aloud. We use the Carol Marsh mysteries as a big part of theme units that we do.My son enjoys first looking at the pictures of the children in the introduction, and reading about who they are in real life.We then copy the scavenger hunt in the back of the book, so that he can keep check off the items as the appear in the book.These are excellent books for a read aloud in a learning situation, but the language is appropriate and the chapters are short enough for children to read on their own.I enjoyed Christina's attitude towards the topic of Davy Crockett and the Alamo - ""That's boy stuff!"" she declared, but it wasn't soon until she was enjoying the story too.The short Spanish language glossary with common Spanish words that was in the back of this book was particularly helpful and fun.These books are not first class mystery books from an adult standpoint, but that is not what is important - what matters is that these stories are close enough to reality, and involve enough children's interests, that the child enjoys the book and learns a lot about Texas history along the way.For a good unit study, provide a copy of a Texas map (There's one in the book!), and pair this book with an appropriate biography book for kids on Davy Crockett. We also watched ""Dear America: A Line in the Sand:The Alamo Diary of Lucinda Lawrence Gonzales, Texas, 1836.""
Summary 2: I am writing this review based on the words of my 4th grade son. He was really excited to get this book as he thought that it was going to be a great story. His grandparents live in TX and he thought that it would be a lot of fun to read a book that takes place where they live.He breezed through the book and then was SOOOO disappointed at the ending. He said that just as the book was getting more exciting, it just ended. He was really wishing that the author could have solved the mystery of the boy ghost.Hope that our next book is a better one. He said that he would NOT recommend this book to a friend.
Summary 3: There are not many novels out there regarding Texas history, it was a nice change as a teacher to be able to mix readng and social studies. The story was well written and my ESL students are truly ejoying the novel. Thank you.
Summary 4: We read the Mystery and Mount Vernon and love it. This Alamo one was not so exciting. The perpetrator who was arrested was actually a child - which turned me off a lot. The historical information on the Alamo is good, and we love the characters in these books. Will probably read more, but get them from the library rather than invest in them."
0976435209,DIVINE CHUCKLES - Life From A Higher Perspective,"Summary 1: This is a beautiful, healing book with the kind of message, warmth and humor that our fractured world needs so badly. The strength and spirit of this book captured my attention and my imagination. As an author and an avid reader, I tend to look at most books with a critical eye. I found it impossible, however, to assess this book with my eyes or my mind, because it spoke directly to my heart. If you want to tap into and bring forward the highest and best within yourself, this is absolutely the book for you.
Summary 2: ""Divine Chuckles"" is a treasure. ""Spirit""'s wisdom, warmth and humor has something great to offer anyone who chooses to listen.
Summary 3: I too must say, as the previous reviewer has already stated, this book DOES indeed speak to one's heart, but it also seeks to reach our minds as well...mostly in a very light-hearted, humorous manner, which is such a welcoming change. The most important aspect I found in this book and greatly appreciate, is that with all of our vast differences and no matter how good or badly we may behave, we are not being judged or critisized. There is a geuine expression of unconditional love and acceptance that speaks through. Hoping that one day people may begin to truly and fully understand our divinely inherent nature, while at the same time, allowing our minds to embrace this wonder in ourselves.
Summary 4: Lin David Martin is an exceptional teacher. I have experienced his work in person on numerous occasions, and his words, ideas and suggestions are always deeply moving and relevant. All who experience his work walk away with a special feeling of understanding and love, in the truest sense of those words. Lin is the real deal. I dislike few things more than a charlatan that misleads others, and there are plenty of those individuals operating under the guise of ""minister,"" ""preacher,"" ""teacher,"" etc. Lin is 100% authentic, on all levels, and there is no mistaking the quality and depth of his work. He does individual sessions, writes books and gives talks to small and large groups; no matter how one experiences him, in the end it is well worth the time and effort. I recommend Lin and his work unequivocally. At 54 years of age, having been a ""seeker"" for many years, I have experience a great many teachers; few have affected me as deeply as Lin David Martin."
B0006BR006,"Dark companion;: The story of Matthew Henson, (A Fawcett premier book)","Summary 1: Hi.My name is Aviaq Henson from Greenland.I believe that Matthew Henson had wrote that book because all he said was true, why would a black man lie to write that book while there was still much of racism in societies. Only a true story would let a black man write in the early times.Greentings from Greenland.
Summary 2: i must say this book initiated feelings i had not expected.i bought the book as a source of african american history butas i read further, i got drawn into the life of a kid from thelast vestiges of slavery who despite the obvious nefariousconditions for a black kid during those times, was allowed tofollow a dream of exploration by gaining and earning acceptancefrom those good people willing to ""give the guy a chance"".This book is much more than a story of a black kid who despitenever ending verbal attacks (many to this day)did what he wishedand contributed to humanity, it is a book that proves thereare no limits whenever humans are able to forget their minordifferences and intelligently solve any predicament.Kudos to Mr. Robinson!!!
Summary 3: This book is an inspirational read. I've always been fascinated by polar explorers (especially the early ones) because of the privations they suffered, and for nothing but recognition and desire to see what hasn't yet been seen.Juxtapose the sub-plot of a noted Naval navigator, driven to make his mark in the world, forming a relationship with a black man (very free-thinking in those days) that made both men stronger than they would have been on their own, and you have a truly a fascinating story.It's too bad that so much has to be made of the fact that Henson was a black man, but it mattered then, and sadly, it matters now. If Peary didn't think it was issue 80 years ago, why is race still an issue? This is the question that forms an undercurrent to the story in the book. Someday, perhaps, we'll talk of Peary and Henson's exploits, and the word &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; will only be relevent when disussing seal noses and snow....
Summary 4: This is a wonderful book for all ages. I wish that I'd read it as a kid because it portrays the enormity of the challenge in a way that astounds the reader.That Mr. Robinson had the blessing and resources of Mr. Henson really adds to the authenticity of this work. It reads really well. Mr. Robinson assembled the memoirs with great craft and thought without leaving you feeling that the writer was in the way.Instead, he wrote a compelling story of an amazing feat that brings the reader right inside the story. Honestly, there were so many instances when the descriptions were so perfectly written that I felt that I was there.From Matt's running away as a child to his tutelage on the sea on to Central America and Greenland.Matt's early days with the natives of Greenland. Their acceptance of him as a lost brother (ancestral memory of the African Diaspora?.. who knows?) His learning their ways. The bear hunt was incredibly invigorating to read.There are so many chapters that boggle the mind. The chapter where Peary's toes get frostbitten, and how Matt saves him. This was November in the Arctic. Pitch black; unimaginable cold. The hardship was palpable. And when Matt broke through the ice, I had no idea how he could've survived.An extremely compelling read. Whether you're 8 or 80, this book is a Great Adventure and I can't imagine anyone having written it better. When you're done, don't forget to visit the website which is a wonderfully rich resource. Verne has devoted a great deal of love and energy into it.Thanks for preserving this book Verne!
Summary 5: I was 14 years of age when I first read Dark Companion, and it set the course of my life. Being a black child, I, like other blacks, or Negroes as we were call then (1948) were told of the so many things we could not do. &quot;White people would never allow you to do this, or that&quot; we the youth were told by our (well meaning) elders. My childhood dreams would be shattered the moment I spoke them aloud,, that is until I read of Mr. Matthew Henson adventures. His life story blow my mind. And convinced me that black people could be heroes too.After that reading experience, no one could convince me that I couldn't do the things, and live the life, I have lived. Proof, I am now the author of WHAT'S A COMMIE EVER DONE TO BLACK PEOPLE? (a Korean war memoir) Publish by McFarland Publishers 1997. Also, RETURN OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN, by Kroshka Books, both are true life adventures. I am also nearing the completion of a series of African mythologies (illustrated books of children's stories) Stories I learn during my 11 years of living amongst the people of my ancestors in Ghana, west Africa, who adoptive me during my Sankofa there.Alone with my grandfather, who was 12, when the civil-war begun, Mr. Matthew A. Henson memories will always remain with me. He was one of the first African-Americans, sources of inspiration to me. And I strongly encourage all to read his Dark Companion. I also salute Mr. Bradley Robinson, and his son, for their authorship.Curtis J. Morrow Author"
1904550401,"Sign and Sing Along: Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear!","Summary 1: ""Hold out your Teddy Bear arms...!"" (hug, hug)That's how storytime begins with this book, which will encourage active participation even in babies who aren't signing.Very cute pictures of babies and helpful captions for parents on the pictures of signs make this a series of books you will enjoy together again and again.Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear includes many very useful basic signs. This isn't my favourite of the series - I guess because it's a rhyme, not a song, but DD2 still loves hearing it.Recommended for ages 1-2 only, as it's a very basic rhyme that older toddlers will probably not sit still for for long.
Summary 2: So cute. I've always loved this rhyme anyhow. The pictures are sweet and colorful, and I love the picture-summary of all the actions at the end, particularly for children not yet able to attend to pictures for long. It's a great warm-up for my speech and language sessions with toddlers and preschoolers with lots of receptive and expressive language opportunities, imitation, and improvisation. Nice job!
Summary 3: we already had a book from Annie Kubler that Marylou loves (Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes (null)) as well as a sign language book from Joy Allen (Baby Signs) so i thought we had a good idea of what to expect. i went with teddy bear because i just could not remember the song but remember loving it as a kid and i wanted to share that with our daughter. Marylou was 17 months when it arrived and we haven't had it for very long.the design was pretty similar in style to our other Annie Kubler which we like. Marylou seems to find the drawings engaging, they seem simple to me but i'm not the target audience my daughter is and she likes it. One difference in style that bothers me is the drawings are smaller with more on each page. its a longer song and i can see why but my daughter doesn't love this book as much as the other one.The song is exactly what i was trying to find and Marylou seems to find it fun, she does pay more attention to me then to the book.The sign language isn't exactly what i was hoping for. Mostly its cute and easy to follow and Marylou is watching me closely while i sign the song. the down side is ""turn out the light"" its very hard to see what i'm supposed to do with my hand, is that a fully opened hand? a closed hand? just two fingers? i don't know sign language and am learning with my daughter while teaching her so i wish that part was clearer because i don't know the sign. i do like that on the back pages is the different signs repeated which is super helpful for the learning momma :)for an added bonus the different pages have different babies. each baby has a teddy bear that matches the cloths the baby is wearing. for us this means another learning angle for the book; colors, dots, stripes, stars, ect.Marylou seems to bring me the book often (but not so much that i feel like putting out of reach for a break) so i think she likes it. :) she does watch momma way more then she looks at the pictures in the book. the best part is that it is in fact the song i grew up with it :)
Summary 4: I bought this for my daugher when she was 14 months old. She already knew some sign language, and I thought she would enjoy this book. I'm not sure that she learned any signs from the book except for ""teddy bear"", but she sure loves moving to it and following the directions. I don't know if this rhyme traditionally had a tune, but I made one up for it. Whenever she gets squirmy when we are out, I start singing the little tune, and she hops right up and follows the directions (turn around, touch the ground, etc). She's not quite as interested in it now that she's 21 months old, but it's still a very fun book to read.
Summary 5: I have a 10mth old girl and she just loves this book. I found the seller great to purchase with. I had no hassel at all. Makes buying fun when you don't have to worry about delays."
B000O2PYH8,The Saint of the Wilderness: a Biographical Novel on the Life of Robert Sayers Sheffey,"Summary 1: This book is excellent! It was even better than the movie. It was well worth the money to get it.
Summary 2: Loved that the book arrived so soon. That was a nice surprise. It was everything it was described to be and can't wait to read very page.
Summary 3: thanks for sending it promptly,it arrived much quicker than i thought it would and so i was able to give it as a Christmas present ,God bless from daithi"
0060953675,The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel,"Summary 1: This book has all the right ingredients to make a delicious dish: description of good food, a group of wise Latin women and a lot of Latin culture and folklore. This combined with the story of Claire, a young woman who struggles with life in New York, should have made this book into a treat. However the author, which no doubt has a lot of Latin knowledge - did not deliver. The dish that came out is tedious and didactic.I assume that Lori Marie Carlson is very educated with the matter of Latin culture - and definitely has a vast knowledge about food, music and poetry. I also assume she chose this book as a means to enrich the reader with her wisdom. It is clear that a lot of research was done before writing this book; however the book does not rise above its didactic informative descriptions that seem to lead nowhere.Claire meets her Latin friends to a monthly feast called ""Tertulia"" which is described as a ""gathering of confidants who share poetic musings, secret sorrows and savory treats"". Each chapter in the book is dedicated to one such meeting while in between we read something about Claire's life - but this serves only as a smooth passage to the ""Tertulia"" and its different monthly subject.The main part of the book is dedicated to the different views, the diverse ways to translate life as experienced by the participants of the Tertulia: Sonia, Luna, Isabela, Pearl, Aroma, Winifred. Each one with her own philosophy. I cannot say that these women are not wise. They do have fine things to say and some of their stories can be interesting but all in all, the entire story does not get anywhere and the conversation between the women is wearisome and slow. I cannot believe that this is a true account of the way people speak. I have been in many women gatherings where one issue leads to another and a topic can be discussed with a lot of laughter and tears - but no informal conversation I have joined was ever held in a form of lecture where every woman says what she has to say in a sort of speech and then shuts up. At least, this does not happen with the women I know.The book does not allow any real development of characters - not Claire, whom the other women wish so much to ""educate"" and not any one of the other wiser women. The reader does not really care what happens to them next or what they have to say.
Summary 2: During the time I lived in Spain, I remember vividly tuning into the tertulias that were on every day, often featuring famous writers like Cela or Marquez commenting on issues of the day. I marveled over the fact that unlike in our American talk shows, they actually ate food, had coffee, and really got into their conversations in an in-depth manner.Thus it was with much anticipation that I picked up this book which features a group of woman who meet in a tertulia fashion to discuss everything from beauty and dating to betrayal and loss. Our narrator is the only non-Latina, but she fits right in since she speaks Spanish and relates to the culture. The others hail from various professional fields. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was slightly disappointed. I never felt that I learned enough about any one person to care that much about what happened to her. Therefore, I found myself feeling somewhat detached even through various tales of illness and infidelity. The narrative is a bit scattered and doesn't hold together at times. There is very little in the way of real character development. A good first novel with some promising scenes.
Summary 3: I minored in Spanish, was an exhange student in Madrid and embrace many aspects of Latin culture and devour lots and lots of Latino and Hispanic Lit. The idea for this book had so much potential, but the novel just doesn't work. It's hard to believe or get into the voice of the narrator, Claire, an adult young woman character because she comes off girlish, shallow, and wholly boring, and the Latina characters were just too superficially written to retain my interest and were unbelievable because they lacked depth and human oddities and characteristics that make characters in literature so memorable. The women either come off too saintly to believe or stereotypical. The concept for the novel was great, but the writer fails because this novel doesn't have ironies, interesting drama, complex personality contradictions within the characters, a fresh or provocative writing style, believable epiphanies, or any treats the reader can take away with her/him.
Summary 4: I was soooo looking forward to reading this book but it just didn't do it for me. I was intrigued by the meetings of women of various generations and the Spanish (food) theme--just the right mix for me, so I thought. It just dragged and never made me feel involved or care about the characters. :(
Summary 5: For years I was one of the guys. It is only since graduating from college and joining the &quot;real world&quot; that I've developed girlfriends. This book made me think of our girls' night out meetings over coffee and wine, times that I both need and treasure.I had been expecting more of a novel, more details about the characters' lives. The chapters, instead, were a brief statement of the characters' current lives and the reactions of the tertulia attendants. I did feel like there was wisdom and truth in the women's thoughts. One thing I did especially like was that the author made sure to provide translations of the Spanish comments and proverbs."
9962629365,El Valle Prohibido: The Forbidden Valley (Spanish and English Edition),"Summary 1: Eduardo Lince F&aacute;brega's first novel of his Anton Valley trilogy is such a marvelous story that lifts you away and takes you straight to the heart of the nature of Panama.Even if you've never traveled to Anton Valley in real life, you become a first hand spectator of the fabulous locations that inspired the novel, get lost between the veils of popular children's legends, feel compassion for the characters and thrilled with the array of good and evil beings that inhabit both the pages of this book and the imagination of its author, depicted by the creativity and charming style of M. Javier de Gracia's illustrations.I recommend this reading for fantasy and nature enthusiasts, and specially for children who will surely learn the value of love, respect for all living beings, and above all, pureness of heart.
Summary 2: Secrets overshadow the Forbidden Valley, and humanity holds the key to their discovery. A bewitching adventure that made me wonder just who controls our world. A super read! And it's bilingual to boot!
Summary 3: No lo pude soltar hasta llegar al final ya que mezcla el humor con las aventuras imparables. Los personajes son m&aacute;gicos. Adem&aacute;s es refrescante ver leyendas europeas y del continente americano top&aacute;ndose cara a cara, sumado a un excelente mensaje ecol&oacute;gico. La edici&oacute;n biling&uuml;e es excelente para los que quieran reforzar cualquiera de los idiomas. Yo dir&iacute;a que igual lo disfrutan jovenes y adultos."
1560974664,"B. Krigstein, Volume 1","Summary 1: the world was not ready for the work of bernie krigstein when he hit his stride in comics in the early 50's. a fine artist at heart, he became obsessed with the art form of comics and the possibilities that it held. few were attempting to take comics so seriously and in those days, they were just above pornography as far as respectability goes. he produced some brilliant works, but the book reveals just how much of a struggle it was to get these masterworks in print. the artwork speaks for itself, but i was really drawn into the text which details the inner workings of the comics machine of the 1940's-50's and how ridiculously it was run. although he begged and pleaded with management, he was never able to bring a story out further than 9 pages, and had to threaten leaving in order to even ink his own work rather than have it butchered by someone else. considering the roadblocks that constantly stood in front of him, it was amazing that he was able to experiment as much as he did.among his more famous experiments was panel subdivision, breaking away from the standard 6-9 panels per page and, in one instance, producing some 75 panels in 6 pages. this brought an entirely new dimension to comics, introducing the break down of time and space within the page. he also brought a style of cinematography that was never thought of in comics before that must have influenced filmmakers years down the road.greg sadowski has assembled a truly staggering biography. he had direct access to the artists collection and publishes for the first time many works that have never seen the light of day. rare artist photostats of pencil artwork that went on to be mutiliated by someone else's inks. original panels that were ordered by management to be covered up with different artwork. exhaustive research with coworkers, friends and family, as well as unbelievably wise words from the artist himself given in various interviews many years ago that gives a definitive look into the workings of this man's artistic mind.it must [stink] being the pioneer, you never get to see the fruits of your labor. but all who charged through the door that b krigstein kicked down acknowledge him as the man who started it all.THIS BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR ANY COMIC ART FAN, AS WELL AS ANY ARTIST OF ANY TYPE. IT IS VERY INSPIRING AND IS A GREAT READ.
Summary 2: This book will show you all the reasons for my title. Mr.Krigstein was truly a master at pacing and design on the comic page.His art speaks far better than I can write so I'll just tell you if you buy this book you will not be disapointed.The comic Master Race alone is worth the price of this book.
Summary 3: Bernard Krigstein is most famous as one of the pantheon of extraordinary artists working for EC comics in the Fifties. However, this volume shows that EC was just one facet of this comics genius. This is a thorough biography, plus a wonderful analysis of Krigstein's life's work. This book, along with the companion volume ""B.Krigstein: Comics,"" belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in comics history and sequential art.
Summary 4: Greg Sadowski's biography of Bernard Krigstein, who possessed one of the most innovative minds---and pens---in comic book history, is a labor of love that is revealed as such on every page. From the high quality of the paper to the superb graphic design, from the sharp reproductions to the text that details his life, career, and reputation, B. KRIGSTEIN is a book that would grace any library. But it covers not only his comic book work. For here are also his many book illustrations, his World War II field sketches and paintings, his canvases and gallery works (among them portraits of his wife and family), urban vignettes and rural landscapes, even greeting cards, gum cards,and advertising art. He was truly a modern-day Renaissance man, fully deserving of this highly focused, incredibly beautiful tribute. There have been many innovators in comic art over the decades (George Herriman and Art Spiegelman, to name just two), but none of them had Krigstein's range of powers and depth of creativity. His was a name that the centuries will remember."
0395510856,Family Bonds: Adoption and the Politics of Parenting,"Summary 1: I found Elizabeth Bartholet's view of parenting to be thoughtful, intelligent and compassionate. As the birth mother of one, this book made me want to consider adoption as a compassionate way to expand my family -- even without fertility problems as the motivation.
Summary 2: Family Bonds is a bit more personal than Bartholet's other title, Nobody's Children. Bartholet is a mother to one child born prior to her divorce, and two boys adopted from Peru as a single, divorcee. Batholet states that ""The myth is that the legal structure surrounding adoption is designed to serve the best interests of the child. Actually experiencing the system as an adoptive parent shattered this myth for me."" As a woman who endured the international adoption process I too had this myth shattered. The current adoption system, both domestic and international, is a travesty. The needs of children are the lowest priority and their ""best interests"" is something to which only lip service is paid. Anyone who has traveled to a foreign country can attest to the heartbreaking conditions of orphanages and the bizarre affinity for orphanages over international adoption. You need only be exposed briefly to babies languishing in wooden cribs or strapped to potties as early as possible to be appalled by the fact that so-called ""advocates"" for children oppose adoption and actually support anti-adoption sentiments. Most of the children in these orphanages are not legally ""available"" for adoption, yet they are purportedly ""better off"" being NOBODY'S CHILD than being an American's child. It is a disquieting notion, but nonetheless a reality.Elizabeth Bartholet is a voice of reason in the adoption world; a world that is sadly perverted by anti-adoption forces clinging to a mythological ideology that blood equates to the best parenting scenario for all children. This is a dangerous ideology as many are willing to sacrifice children's lives in order to defend it. Children rot away in the foster care system and most are reunited with their parents at all costs - to the point that many are killed by their biological parents who are unfit to parent them. It is reminiscent of Shirley Jackson's short story The Lottery. We cling to barbaric ways simply because it is ""the way we've always done it"".
Summary 3: If you're an adoptee or birthmother, don't waste your money on this narrow-minded view of adoption. Bartholet has little to say about birthmothers! When she does mention birthmothers, she seems to view them as inconsequential baby machines. No empathy in this book!"
0415110882,Colloquial Hindi: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series),"Summary 1: Bohut acche! Tej K. Bhatia's book is an outstanding, gentle, yet comprehensive introduction to the Hindi language for a beginner. It's difficult to cite the numerous reasons why this book is so valuable for the apprehensive beginning language-learner, but I'll make an attempt to summarize the high points:(1) Bhatia is careful not to overwhelm the beginning learner with the complexities of the Devanagari script too early. He has the perfect instructor's touch here, rendering most of the early dialogues in Roman characters while gradually easing the learner into Devanagari as he/she gains more confidence in the basics of speaking and comprehending.(2) Bhatia's book has just enough grammar to give any Hindi learner a handy mental framework for organizing the rules of sentence construction, without being too intimidating. Happily, Hindi grammar resembles that of Mandarin Chinese in some respects, though not quite as simple as Mandarin-- it's fairly consistent, broad-brushed enough to allow sophisticated emotional and logical expression yet accessible enough that even beginning students can basically vocalize their thoughts after just a couple weeks of study. Bhatia does a fine job of really organizing this grammar in the right sequence, explaining the niceties of Hindi syntax while taking some of the language's trickier aspects (e.g. postpositions, as in Japanese, participles, causatives, the oblique) and making them seem eminently manageable.(3) Pronunciation, often neglected in self-teaching language books, gets more than a cursory treatment here, an asset not to be downplayed!(4) The tape/CDs have a wealth of spoken material and can be conveniently played at home, on the road or on the plane or train or bus.(5) Bhatia's book, as the series title suggests, really focuses on Hindi as a colloquial idiom. While this may at first seem trivial, it's a very important asset to his book! In India, there are in effect two forms of Hindi-- the formalized literary version used in ceremonial and official circumstances, and the popular ""Bollywood"" Hindi that's used on the street and in the markets throughout India and, indeed, much of the world (including in quite a few South Asian shops in New York City, where this ""common Hindi"" is a sort of lingua franca). It's this colloquial Hindi (very closely resembling Urdu), essentially, that's so rapidly become a world language and taken much of the world by storm as Bollywood movies and music, among other Indian exports, become so popular.In practice, this ""colloquial Hindi"" isn't even entirely Hindi, but a hybrid spoken tongue with a Hindi foundation plus plenty of contributions from Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and other Indian as well as European languages tossed in to spice the mix, popular throughout the Subcontinent in its varieties. While Bhatia doesn't delve too much into the varied vocabulary of this ""dialectical Hindi(ish)"" language, his dialogues and idiomatic expressions do a fine job of conveying true conversational Hindi to the learner and thus providing a nice basis for communicating in the popular Hindi that's actually used between native speakers.In its dialectical varieties, Hindi-Urdu has close to a billion speakers worldwide, may soon become a UN official language and-- along with Spanish and Mandarin Chinese-- may well be one of the ""essential languages"" of the 21st century as India continues its ascent. Moreover, since Hindi is a fellow Indo-European language, it has enough similarities to intrigue and delight a native European-language speaker and smooth the learning process. In fact, if you've already learned an important European language like French, German or Spanish-- or Farsi Persian or Dari, which Hindi-Urdu in many ways resembles-- you'll have a headstart in mastering the quirks and structures of Hindi, especially as Bhatia presents it.Besides which, Hindi is a beautiful and poetic language that sings as much as it speaks, equally at home conveying complicated scientific concepts as in expressing the deepest emotions of the heart. Bhatia is an experienced and talented teacher of this wonderful language, and after just a couple months of studying you'll find yourself able to communicate at a decent level, maybe even humming some Hindi music during your lunch break.
Summary 2: This is a fantastic resource. I have just received my copy and already I am in love with it. It is very well-written, and strikes a nice balance between the structure of the langauge and usability. I especially like that the author is no fan of prescriptivists, and so presents ""Hindi as she is spoke"". I would not say that it is ""better"" than Snell's TYH, but it takes a slightly different approach, and is, in my opinion a great complement to the other work.My only gripes are the way that all the devanagari is stuck at the back (grr!) and that I had to buy the book and CD separately. Even with those minuses, it is absolutely worth it, and I would rate it a must have.
Summary 3: An excellent book for beginners, like the title implies, it is mainly a course in Colloqial Hindi, and almost omits the Devanagari syllbary entirely. There is only one chapter on it, but that chapter is very helpful all the same. The tape that comes with the book is a necessary element; it is integrated with the exercises in the book quite nicely, so make sure you get the cassette as well. The romanisation scheme is weird, but it's not too difficult. As an introduction to spoken Hindi, this can't be beat. For a better knowledge of the Devanagari syllabary, I would recommend Snell's &quot;Teach Yourself Hindi&quot;.
Summary 4: I found it clear, gradual and (most over all) aware of the non-linguistic rules related to conversation. I disagree with the &quot;London reader&quot;: I found the romanization good and easy to follow... maybe it's 'cause I'm italian or 'cause I was teaching myself Hindi just for pleasure, so I wasn't expecting nothing more than an aid!
Summary 5: I purchased both the book and the audio CD, and so far I've read maybe 8 or so pages, but have played the CDs quite a bit as a companion to my daily commute. Bhatia is my first exposure to Hindi langauge instruction. So far the experience has been enjoyable, though a lot of Hindi letters sound alike to my tin ear.Compared to products I've used for other langauges (mostly Berlitz tapes), the Hindi CD is a vast improvement, moving beyond ""set piece conversation"" into more general usage.Obviously, I'm not in a position to critique Bhatia's style of instruction or other technical details.The CDs I received are ""burned"" (CD-Rs) with one-color silk screening, and not pressed. That's OK, but for extra safety, ripping a copy for general use is recommended. Keeping CD-Rs in hot cars is an express ticket to data oblivion.My only minor gripe is that I wish that those who write about Hindi or Indian culture would stop apologizing for India's social problems. Remember, the USA broke away from Great Britain in 1776 with a population of about 3 million. India started her own path in 1947 with a population hundreds of times greater. It took the USA roughly 70-80 years to achieve social and economic milestones comparable to Europe. So just chill and remember that respect comes to those with lots of money and power (such as one gains by splitting the atom.)"
0440414032,Humbug Mountain,"Summary 1: Another delightful and funny book, this time about a traveling family, bound for Humbug Mountain to find a rich relative and settle down in peace. This being a Fleischman novel, you can bet there are plenty of twists and turns along the way--and laughs to go with them. Check it out!
Summary 2: I was pleased to find a childhood favorite that I could pass on to my 10 year old son. The book although old, was in great condition and arrived very quickly.
Summary 3: ""Humbug Mountain""Written by Sid FleischmanIllustrated by Eric Von Schmidt----------------------------------------------------This 1978 novel is another fun, frontiers-y epic from author Sid Fleischman, about a traveling family led by a newspaperman father and his stolid wife, who decide to settle down in a new settlement in the high plains which turns out to be a little more rustic than they anticipated: turns out it hasn't even been built yet! Stranded in the middle of nowhere, they are beset upon by bandits, buffalo bones and galloping gold prospectors. The tone is a little rougher than some of his other out-West books, with the menace of violence from creepy badguys Shagnasty John and the sinister, club-wielding Fool Killer. Probably best for tweens, though still leavened with humor like Fleischman's other books... Another enjoyable book, with illustrations from '60s folksinger/artist Eric Von Schmidt... give 'er a spin! (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's book reviews)"
0793823846,Maltese,"Summary 1: This authors of this book really needed the assistance of a professional writer! There is a lot of general information, and the specific information that is included is rather dated (as can be expected; Barbara Bergquist has been involved with the Maltese fancy for about forty years!)I am reading all I can about Maltese, and suggest that serious fanciers (or would-be serious fanciers) get The Complete Maltese by Cutillo, that people who want a good overview of the breed get Howell Book House's The Essential Maltese, and that both get Dog Fancy's Popular Breed Series publication about Maltese (at larger pet stores or www.dogfancy.com).
Summary 2: I have read this book and I know of Mrs Barbara Bergquist. She has given her heart and soul to the Maltese breed. I do not think anyone has been able to match her. She cares about the breed, and not as a money maker. Her Kennel name is second to none over the years. Granted Mrs Bergquist is older now and not able to show as often. This book will get you started and put you in the game. Must be a reason its still being printed after all these years.
Summary 3: I rescued a Maltese a year ago and my life has been filled with special joy since then. I can't get enough information about this breed and this book will be a valuable addition to my resource collection."
0976650304,Danger Quicksand - Have A Nice Day- An unconvential guide to surviving corporate employment,"Summary 1: Earlier this year I made a career change, leaving a job I'd held for more than six years. For four or more of those years I thought I had ""the perfect job"" (for me) and quite seriously thought I might be one of the rare souls who stays working for the same company for most of their life. I thrived on going the extra mile and working miracles, as it were.Conditions changed, internal conditions deteriorated, and the perfect job morphed into a soul-draining daily drudge.Luckily for me I found David's blog (where he first fleshed out the essays in this book) and his advice helped me dispassionately assess my current situation, understand what had been happening and why, and gave me the motivation and optimism to make a career change. By the time he published his book I'd left the toxic job, was earning more, working with people who respected me, and had also begun working on a self-publishing project of my own to provide some secondary income.I'm sure that anyone who wants to do better in life will gain far more than $19.95 worth of insight & perspective from reading this book.
Summary 2: Most books dealing with careers start out by showing the reader how he or she can go about landing a great job. David St. Lawrence does things differently. His primary audience is people who already have jobs, especially those who work in large corporations, and who either sense that things are somehow going wrong... or fail to sense it. I think it is fair to say that St. Lawrence doesn't regard the working environment at most large companies as reflecting the values we would most like to see there: truth, fairness, reward according to merit, and excellent communication. What he writes about the fate of whistle blowers is one of many examples he cites of upended ethics. Indeed, his view of the corporate working life is infused with darkness-though he lightens this with nice touches of humor, and tangy expressions. For example, one subchapter is entitled ""Why Your Manager Lies."" You've just got to read that part, for sure.It's not as if the author doesn't recognize that there can be some awfully attractive elements to corporate life. Another subchapter is: ""Seduced by a Fantastic Job."" But he emphasizes the risks of wholehearted subscription to a company's work ethic, and doesn't hesitate to cite the costs of such dedication that he has paid in his own career.Much of the first two-thirds of Danger Quicksand is devoted to coaching employees on how to analyze their work environment, and counseling employees on what to do before or after the environment becomes insupportable. His term is ""exit strategy."" The last part of the book, however, develops some more hopeful themes: work-family balance; how to get a better job with a better company; and ""doing your own thing"" by starting a ""micro business"" are three of them.If you are working, and feeling uneasy about your career, reading Danger Quicksand might make you more uncomfortable. But it also might impel you to take action that will ultimately benefit you greatly.
Summary 3: David has a great way of bringing the stuff thats going on around you in the corporate world into focus so that you can make reasoned decisions about your career path.
Summary 4: Danger Quicksand is the most honest career advice book I've ever read. I encountered it first online after I complained about my situation to my partner, a practicing psychiatrist, and we sought an outside perspective to bounce our thoughts off of. We got more than we bargained for in St. Lawrence's book and highly recommend it. Beyond salient section titles like ""Signs of a Problem Workplace"" and ""Why Your Manager Lies,"" you will encounter heaps of worthwhile advice like the choices we can make (Voting with our feet, p.112), how to treat co-workers (You will find that it is far better to be interested in others than to be interesting to others. It is also saner, p.106), and what can happen after whistleblowing ([This about co-workers:] They recognize you as a lightning rod that is already buzzing with a corona discharge and will withdraw from you at the first opportunity, p.85). It must be noted that St. Lawrence has been trained as an engineer. One criticism my partner had of the book is that it devotes little space, if any, to salvaging a problem workplace. Here, St. Lawrence's message is more realistic and just the opposite: He wants to help people take responsibility for their careers and bail out of difficult situations to find better workplaces or independent employment opportunities. So, if you are in need of some saavy advice and ready to help yourself, St. Lawrence has written this book for you. It's never too late."
159486120X,The Slam: Bobby Jones and the Price of Glory,"Summary 1: A marvelous look at the pressure that a champion athlete faces as he attempts to achieve something never done before. Few accounts offer the depth Mr. Sampson does as to the pressure Bobby Jones faced and the turmoil he experienced as he attempted to win the 1930 Grand Slam. The Bobby Jones of""The Slam"" is a fellow you would want to play a round with and then drink a round with, and not the marble statute of most golf hagiography. Jones comes across as talented, driven, conflicted, troubled, yet handling the pressure with grace and resolve.Mr. Sampson has a cynical side to his writing, and it comes out in this book in his accounts of Jones and the USGA. Mr. Sampson spends a significant amount of time in explicit and implicit references to a controversial ruling on the next to last hole of the 1930 US Open. The ruling may have kept Jones from missing first place. However, as much time as Sampson devotes to what is arguably the critical point of the 1930 campaign, he still does not fully bring the point home. The ruling was based on a local rule, and Sampson suggests that the rule was not made evident to the players. Yet Mark Frost's biography of Jones indicates that all players were made aware of the rule. Who is correct? Sampson talks about players complaining about the ruling, but who were the players? Supposedly the ruling not only saved Jones a stroke, but placed him in an exceptionally advantageous position for his next shot...but from Mr. Sampson's description I could not get a good fix on the geography. A map would have been helpful.A good book, and a book that does Bobby Jones a service in making him human again, but often hampered by the author's tunnel vision about ""The Ruling"" and the man who made it, Prescott Bush. Yep, the future US Senator and father and grandfather to presidents.
Summary 2: I am puzzled at why Sampson would set out to deminish Jones and his family. I noted that some of ""his"" facts are actually completely different in other books that are exhaustively researched such as Mark Frost's book The Grand Slam and others I have read including Down the Fairway by Jones himself. Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was. He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being. He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc. I enjoyed the pictures.
Summary 3: I was pleasantly surprised with 'The Slam'. I have come to enjoy Curt's books over the years, but this one is his best, by far. (...)"
B000PCDBYK,A Tiger Called Thomas,"Summary 1: Yes, I thought this book was OK but my five-year-old really liked it and asked me to read it over and over again. It evidently struck a chord with him.
Summary 2: my 4 year old son really loves this book. the pictures are lovely and the story it tells of a shy boy who thinks others may not like him but they actually do addresses a fear that many children have. also, it's a not scary story that takes place on Halloween. great for showing kids who who fear the holiday that Halloween can be fun.
Summary 3: My daughter (almost 3) enjoyed this book from the library last Halloween & we're looking forward to reading it again this Halloween. I loved introducing her to Halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors, rather than scary monsters, pranks, or candy. The illustrations were lovely. I'm sure the original edition had beautiful illustrations too, and the previous reviewer might have been chagrinned by the changes to a personal childhood favorite. But I'm guessing that most people who, like my family, discover the story for the the first time in this edition will find nothing amiss."
1931160163,The Bachelor Machine,"Summary 1: The truth about science fiction, like stories about [physical activity], is that it is not what it seems: it is rarely science or fiction. M. Christian's work in 'The Bachelor Machine' recognizes this from the first page, taking erotica through some very familiar moves in an environment that all at once is both highly creative yet strikingly familiar (Haven't I dreamed here before? Isn't this a far corner of my mind?). The end result is a collection of fiction that will arouse even the most jaded sci-fi ... devotee and leave you wondering about the next few strangers you encounter (They seem so human, yet I can't help thinking...).Get it, read it, and, if you're really adventurous, go out and live a little sci-fi of your own.
Summary 2: This book is truly a melding of genres. If I were forced at gunpoint to try and label it, I'd call it cyberpunk with sex in. M. Christian manages to create rich, dark worlds which, while not always arousing, all pay tribute to the fact that sex is an essential drive for all of us. Ranging from the merely slightly futuristic to the truly bizarre, his stories force you to question who is the user, and who the used, and what does everyone get out of the wild, wired and fantastic sex depicted in his stories. Don't expect a bedtime story that will ensure sweet, lustful dreams. But definitely expect stories that you'll meet again in your dreams in ways you didn't imagine.
Summary 3: This is a collection of some computer geek's wet dreams. The stories aren't even stories, they're just sex scenes. They are extremely bizarre and took a lot of imagination to create, I'll give it that. But the only person I think who would really enjoy this book is the comic book guy from The Simpsons. If you want a real story with some steamy scenes wrapped in, try Laurell K. Hamilton.
Summary 4: The Bachelor Machine is not simply excellent erotica set in the science fiction genre. It explores issues of identity, psychosexual dynamics, and is incredibly insightful into human nature. This is the best book I have read this year.
Summary 5: M. Christian blends scifi and steamy erotica in this well written tale. I highly recomend this book for somone who is looking for something to expand their boundries."
B000GR2PWS,Katie John,"Summary 1: This is the first in a series of four books with Katie John as a heroine. The books are Katie John (1960), Depend on Katie John (1961), Honestly, Katie John! (1963), and Katie John and Heathcliff (1980).This first book begins shortly after Great-Aunt Emily dies, leaving her large and rambling old house to Katie John's parents. When the Tucker family moves from California to Missouri to see about fixing up and selling the house, ten-year-old Katie John is not at all enthused, but consoles herself that the change is only temporary. As she makes friends with neighbor Sue however, and the two girls explore the house and surrounding countryside together, Katie John's feelings gradually begin to change.She dreams up a plan to save the house and keep it in the family. Set on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, author Mary Calhoun evokes a strong sense of place in this story. The dedication to the book suggests that the setting for this story was based on Mary Calhoun's actual childhood home. Pictures by Paul Frame make the story come alive.Katie John is a lively and spirited heroine, whose impulsive nature is constantly causing her to get into scrapes. I read the first three books in this series in my childhood, and I can highly recommend them.
Summary 2: I love this book! I use to read this book all the time when I was younger! The book is in great condition and the description of the book definitely fits what the book actually looks like! I am very happy with this product!
Summary 3: What a great story! I read this as a girl, and was delighted to find it on Amazon for my ten yr old. She has been using it for a summer reading project, and can hardly put it down. Now for the sequel!
Summary 4: I purchased this book for my nine-year-old daughter because I had enjoyed it so when I was that age (I'm nearly 49). Guess what--it's a huge hit with her, too! She received it a couple months ago, and has already read it twice. She has let other new books go unread as she immerses herself in all things Katie John! I guess it's confirmation that this book really IS a timeless classic.
Summary 5: My friend, Shannon Chalker, got this book and she couldn't put it down! She read half of it in an hour! Today I'm going to check out this book. I hope this review will excite you to read it to!!"
0735540047,Emanuel Law Outlines: Evidence,"Summary 1: This book is also great in providing me the ability to understand laws as they were and are written. I am just starting in this arena, but I have a better understanding than I've had in the past...about law.
Summary 2: At six-hundred pages, your average overworked law student is not too keen on reading another 40 pages a night, especially with a full slate of classes. That being said, this book contains a ""Casebook correlation chart,"" which helps you decide which part of the book to read in the approximate order of your own textbook. It covers: Green Nesson, ""Evidence"" (3rd Ed. 2000); Wellborn, ""Cases & Mat..."" (1st ed. 2000); Mueller & Kirkpatrick, ""Evidence Under the Rules"" (4th Ed. 2000), and Waltz & Park, ""Evidence"" (9th Ed. 1999).I would suggest checking this out of your law library instead of buying it and reading the relevant parts of the ""Capsule Summary"" (79 pages) if you're pressed for time and you want a nuanced overview of Evidence.The rest of the book is nicely outlined, but way too much information for the average to under-achieving student. However if you want it for clarification on certain rules, or just having it in your bookshelf would make you feel better about Evidence, you can get it so cheap that it can't hurt.
Summary 3: A great overview of Evidence Law in the U.S. courts system. I like the outline in the first pages. The price doesn't hurt either!"
0131773151,"Listening to Music, Fourth Edition","Summary 1: If you thot the classics were difficult and boring, well think again! This books bring them alive, and provides a beginner's understanding of just what the classics can mean to anyone. This book is both educational, as well as inspiring - even to anyone on a desert island for the past 50 years. I only wish the opera offering(s) were more extensive;maybe Zorn and August should write a similar version exclusively for opera - I wish they would. This text was required reading for a summer school class at our local Clark College, but it has become a key volume in my meager musical library, and will be referred to often.
Summary 2: I'M SURE GLAD I ORDERED...JUST WHAT I NEEDED AND RIGHT ON TIME FOR SCHOOL..THANKS! A ++++
Summary 3: I just want to say that as my first experience in purchasing at amazon, it went great. I ordered the book and within a matter of days I had it at home. With enough time to read the first chapter for class. Tristan at Lagniappe Books was awesome. Even making sure I had indeed received it. When in need of books I will definitely look to Lagniappe Books."
B0008CPJEW,A child's book of saints,"Summary 1: The book is written, I got the impression, from the viewpoint of elves (or pixies or some such) gathering their impressions of different saints. There was only one ""saint"" whose name I recognized, but the stories were very entertaining and enlightening - and surprisingly spiritual, for a children's book.
Summary 2: When I ordered this book, I was hoping to get a book for my daughter that would teach her about the Catholic saints. I think this book is better read under the influence of hallucinogenics or in a state of temporary insanity. I don't know where the author is coming from. Take this review however you want. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
Summary 3: Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!"
1928746004,The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn,"Summary 1: Having read a number of Custer books, and visited the sight twice anything on the bookshelf about this subject is an immediate purchase.The character development in the first half of the book took a while ( thus 4 rather than 5 stars) but once that was over the story was unraveled in very readable, interesting and fascinating style. The explanation of the deployment of the troops before the Last Stand was really well done and as good an explanation and description as I have read on the subject. This will not be the last book on the subject but it will surely rank as one of the best. Thanks for the epilogue. Great to know what happened to the people involved.
Summary 2: Two of the greatest figures in historical history are put under the microscope. Not only do we learn and walk in the lives of George Armstrong Custer but with General Crazy Horse, an almost Christ-like figure of humility and master of warfare. Crazy Horse fought for his people and their right to their land. Custer was a very complex character who loved his wife and his country, however, he believed he could never be defeated, a modern day warrior with Caesar complex. Robert Skimin has the skill and ability to present these two great leaders warts and all.What exactly led to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. It's inside these pages.
Summary 3: I was compelled to buy this book because of my long-standing interest in the conflicts between the whites and the Indians. This fictional novel, based on historical events, was found to be extremely light. Robert Skimin fleshed out characters, at times, in odd ways. I especially disliked the way real people were saddled with sexual, sadistic, and/or prejudicial characteristics. At times characters seemed to be introduced in a helter skelter manner just to add to the list of real people that he included in the novel. In places, I felt, he mixed combinations of traits just to add a new twist. For example, he had a former Jewish Russian solder, who was a black belt in Judo, defend himself against a sadistic, bigoted and not too bright sargent. Robert Skimin did stay with the historical facts surrounding General Custer and the events that led up to his defeat at the Little Bighorn but as a whole any grade school history student could have easily gotten the same information about the Sioux, Cheyenne, and the 7th Calvary.Also recommended: Custer's Luck, Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of the Oglalas, Killing Custer, Black Elk Speaks, The Road to the Little Big Horn-and Beyond,
Summary 4: This is a wonderful novel written by a gifted author. It's the best book on Custer ever written. Thanks Bob Skimin for keeping me up nights while reading your book."
B000NPSW3E,Trouble in July,"Summary 1: Sheriff McCurtain has a problem. It appears that a negro boy has been accused of raping a white gal. White folk in Flowery Branch can't allow that to happen and so a lynch mob forms. In times of crisis such as this the sheriff does what is politically correct; he goes fishing. This time McCurtain finds himself the fish on the hook who just can't get away no matter how hard he tries.In this masterful piece of literature, Erskine Caldwell unravels before our eyes the pathology and terrorism of lynching in the south. No one could do a better job for Caldwell is a white southerner who grew up in an environment in which lynching was a common form of entertainment. Trouble in July goes deep into the psychology of what makes common white men into brutes and those who work for them into victims.Like many men McCurtain finds it easier to ignore what is going on rather than try to contain the trouble. The more that he tries to wash his hands of the affair the worse it gets. Those in power see the political and economical ramifications of the act and call on him to jail the accused. After all,McCurtain is their political puppet to be manipulated at will.Such an intriguing drama exposes the hypocrasy of the law and shows how fear can make even the most honest of men betray their basic values of justice. Fear reduces the ""negro"" community into one that becomes terrorized and beaten into submission. Fear allows the upholder of the law to allow things to get out of hand merely because he wants to be voted into office next year.Although the characters are simple; their motives, thoughts and values are complex as they struggle with their consciences in carrying out their heinous acts of cowardliness. You have laid out before you the ugliness of a system that dehumanizes everyone involved. The foreward by Bryant Simon in this edition gives us the background which gave rise to this novel. According to Simon, the author has made a significant transition in his work by revealing the south's racism in a straightforward manner. He doesn't hold back the punches.Caldwell has given us a masterpiece about American Terrorism at its zenith in the United States. You will be repulsed, angered, and yes, fearful as you follow the crowd. Our author won't let us become mere voyeurs. We become the lynch mob, the negroes, the soiled politicians and all that is sick in southern terrorism. Read this outstanding work, feel the terror and learn about overcoming the mob psychology in your life. I was deeply moved by Trouble In July and you will too.
Summary 2: Written after the enormous successes of 'Tobacco Road' (1932) and 'God's Little Acre' (1933) and the critical and popular failure of 'Journeyman' (1935), Erskine Caldwell's 'Trouble In July' (1940) is an earnest but listless novel which addresses the lynching of Negroes in the Deep South. Taking place during the period in which it was written, the novel is neither a black comedy burlesque like 'Tobacco Road' nor an example of the more private, pseudo-surrealist fiction Caldwell produced with 'Journeyman' or some of his many short stories of the era.Instead, 'Trouble in July' attempts and fails to achieve a finely poised balance between realistic fiction and a kind of Keystone Cops comedy. But pointed exaggeration at every level was Caldwell's forte, and the novel, which was written with difficulty over a period of several years, is redundant, flat, predictable, and anticlimactic, despite the piling up of several reoccurring cinematic plot devices, such as the worst possible person walking in the door or phoning at the absolute worst time.In Chapter Six, heavily put-upon sheriff and protagonist Jeff McCurtain conceives a plan to escape his duties by inventing a threatening posse of masked bandits, only to find himself held at gunpoint by an identical gang in reality.'Trouble In July' features several politicians who are only concerned that the lynching, which they see as inevitable and acceptable as long as it reflects ""the will of the people,"" not turn public opinion against them, a sheriff's deputy whose great joy in life is ""hunting possums between midnight and dawn and tracking down runaway Negroes at every opportunity,"" vigilante gangs for whom the routine killing of blacks is the umbrella answer to most of life's problems, a religious zealot who is outraged that bibles depicting Christ as a black man are circulating in the Negro community, a signature-gathering campaign to ""send all the Negroes to the country of Africa without delay,"" a black character, the object of the lynching, who is little more than a wide-and-wild eyed caricature, and, among other Caldwell stock characters, a fifteen year-old uneducated white girl with an inordinate appetite for sex and attention.'God's Little Acre' used a similar formula, but that novel, Caldwell's best, was fraught with tension and conflict, and, as a result, contains one of the most suspenseful and poignant climaxes in all of American literature. Perhaps due to the seriousness of its subject, Caldwell's creative exposition in 'Trouble in July' is cautious to the point of being half-hearted, and as a result, the novel, which is never quite believable on any level, creeps and crawls tentatively towards its conclusion rather than galloping confidently ahead.
Summary 3: Sheriff Jeff seems to not have a mind of his own. His only thinking was to keep his position and politics. Author did attempt to show small kinder side to him. The rest of the characters in the book were lunatics but descriptions were great. At times I became so angry I thought I may have to stop reading this book. I did continue on. It many be a fiction story but this really did happen. I have always been intrested in this time period and thought I would have liked to live then. I don't think I would have made it long. I would have been shot for fighting for human rights. What is a political lynching!!! This is the second I have read by this author. I think all the many authors I have been introduced to through my kindle. I never would have chanced buying them or even finding them in our small town library in Northeast Pa. I love it. I plan to read more of this author.Please never forget this time period in our history so will never happen again.
Summary 4: Set in his familiar sandy hills in the Savannah River Valley, Caldwell presents another piece to what he called his Cyclorama of Modern Southern life. The tragedy of Southern race relations after Emancipation is allegorized in the lynching of a young black man for the rape of a white sharecropper's daughter.The closest thing to a main character is the Sheriff of the county, Jeff McCurtain. McCurtain is convinced to ""keep the lynching politically clean."" Representing the political powers of the inter War South, McCurtain is afraid to stand up to the people in the name of the law. As he tries to avoid contact with the lynch mob, he also seeks out a Black man who he considers ""harmless"" and therefore shouldn't be mixed up in the whole lynching.Characters represent the three commonly thought views of Black Americans held by Southern whites at the time. The rich landowner wants the sheriff to catch the suspected racist, so as life can get back to normal and other blacks will keep working his plantation. The catalyst of the incident, a politically involved woman who may be sleeping with the pastor, is circulating a petition that all blacks should be rounded up and sent back to Africa. Yet the third is a man in the mob who is against the petition:""The best way is just like I said. String one of them up ever so often. That'll make all of them keep their place. Hell, if there wasn't no more niggers in the country I'd feel lost without them. Besides, who'd do all the work if the niggers were sent away?""Caldwell appears to have his finger on the pulse of white social-economic view of black Southerners. Like the helots and the Spartans, the backward stagnant economic system of the interwar South is based on white Southerners keeping black Southerners in virtual economic servitude.""Trouble in July"" is the most real of Caldwell's novels in his ""cyclorama"" that I have read yet. The allegory is not too far from the tree as the almost surreal characters in ""Tobacco Road"" and ""God's Little Acre."" However, it does not have the full emersion in the world of the sand hills that the other two have. One almost expects the end where McCurtain begins to question his own actions during the story.All in all I find it not a great work. Its subject matter is more important to the modern reader than some of Caldwell's other works as he like Ida B. Wells, throws the Southern view of civilization upon its head. Additionally, it reminds us why the words of people like Kelly Tilghman, the Golf channel anchor, and Bill O'Reilly (declaring he would lynch Michelle Obama if there was evidence) are so dangerous. People are quick to join mobs and the law is slow to challenge what seems the will of the people even if it is against the very things we stand for."
B0006AISXK,"The Declaration of independence,: A study in the history of political ideas,","Summary 1: Carl L. Becker's book on the Declaration of Independence first appeared nearly eighty years ago, and yet it is still a valuable and stimulating study of its subject. It is dated now, for two large reasons:First, Becker wrote before the revolution in studying the history of ideas, and thus unavoidably predates the close-focus examination of the controversy between Great Britain and her American colonies in the years from 1765 to 1776. Two recent books should be read alongside Becker's monograph -- Pauline Maier's AMERICAN SCRIPTURE: MAKING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (New York: Knopf, 1997; Vintage paperback, 1998), and John Phillip Reid, CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, abridged ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995).Second, Becker focuses on Jefferson as *the* author of the Declaration, neglecting that he was actually the draftsman selected by the Continental Congress and his colleagues within the drafting committee. Thus, the Declaration -- no matter what Jefferson said about it in later life -- was not primarily a window into his own thinking about natural rights and democracy, but rather the final statement by Congress as to the reasons for breaking ties with Britain. To be sure, later generations have read it as an expression of Jefferson's mind -- rather than of &quot;the American mind,&quot; as he put it. But, as Maier shows in AMERICAN SCRIPTURE, Jefferson's thinking was nowhere near as unique or advanced on these subjects as later hero-worshipping biographers have suggested.In particular, as Maier has shown, the age-old dispute about whether Jefferson was or was not influenced by Locke is somewhat beside the point. Even so, Becker's fine book is indispensable for deciding whether we should read the Declaration through Lockean or Jeffersonian lenses, and whether we should regard it as a codification of American aspirations or as a hypocritical catalogue of principles we cannot live up to.R. B. Bernstein, adjunct professor of law, New York Law School
Summary 2: In high school, kids spend time reviewing the Declaration of Independence and learning its meaning. This book goes well beyond that to inspect the thoughts and ideas that were prevalent in the late 18th century and how they influenced the document. Becker goes into great detail about natural rights theory according to John Locke and explores the ins and outs of its implications. This to me was the strongest and most enjoyable part of the book. He also explores the thoughts and ideas that were circulating Britain at the time.Building on this foundation, he weaves a tale as to why certain things were worded as they were (like Britain being run as a ruthless tyrant), and why certain things were left out altogether (like slavery). He also closely examines the changes that took place in the drafts and attributes them to individuals who proofread Jefferson's draft. I really could have done without his granularity in this area.In all, this was a fascinating read. For those of you who want to extend your knowledge beyond the simple presentation of the document you received in high school, I highly recommend buying this book!
Summary 3: In all my studies of the Founders, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence over the last quarter century. I have found no other single book that allowed me to so clearly understand (from Mr Beckers perspective) the feelings, enviornment, philosophies that enriched and motivated the leves and character of our founders like this book does. Becker is a genious in the way he presents step by step the methodical and ever changin adjustments of their reasoning during that critical time in our history. One should not feel their studies complete or even rational until they have obsorbed this unique work. Then and only then can they put all they have learned, studied and pondered into that mixer we call our brains and come up with a true appreciation of the founders and their great work of that era. A must reading. I would only add that even though Becker is perhaps correct in his assertion that Natural Law allowed the colonist to justify their stance against Britan. There is a truth about their religion that I believe should have been emphasised in more detail. Individually many of them were very Godly, the natural law argument allowed them to justify Independence but was not as ingrained into their souls as their religious beliefs were. Otherwise this book is one of a kind.
Summary 4: I have read this book, off and on, several times. It never ceases to amaze me. I tend to be a controversialist and rely upon this book often to help those who seem convinced that the Founding Fathers were of a particular religious persuasion. While foundationally on a personal level this may be true, in general they bowed down to a higher power: Reason. Yet this was not new to them nor were their political theories. Their roots came from somewhere else and that somewhere else was from the European soil they had left.Becker does an awesome job dissecting the Declaration and its influences primarily from Jefferson through Locke. The natural rights philosophy chapter is awesome. This book is over seventy five years old and its arguments have been revisited and even countered but the book is still foundationally necessary for anyone who seeks to study the Declaration of Independence. In terms of studying the Declaration, there is before Becker's book and there is after.There are many revealing insights and oddities that appear when Becker displays the lines that have been cut from the original draft (e.g. notice there is no mention of slavery in the final version; the reasons for its excision are included in the book). These little tidbits opened my eyes a bit to the relatively benign history of this document that I had been taught. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing so have a little fun and check this book out."
1561677663,Pelican Games,"Summary 1: The novel was thoroughly enjoyable and a real page-turner. There is no way of figuring out where the plot is headed.Of course, it is only fiction, but it was fun trying to put real Louisiana faces on the characters.Ron Gomez really does a great job with all the details and suspense. As one of our rare honest and ethical elected officials, Ron understand and has seen the dark underbelly of LA politics.Unfortunately, the book was not only fiction, but more like a fairy tale of LA politics. Here's wishing that one day it may all come true.Ron has always been a great story teller, so it was no great surprise that he has become a talented writer.
Summary 2: This is a really rare novel, a book one can read, see, smell and feel all the way through.The stage on which the drama plays out is Louisiana and the writer portrays Louisiana as the terrible beauty that it is. The themes of the work are woven like threads through the tapestry of the political landscape in Louisiana.The story is universal and has as much relevance to California, Chicago, and New York as it does to New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana.Most importantly, this book delivers what most novels only promise. The pages turn themselves; you cannot put the book down till the end.One of the most difficult things in storytelling is accomplished effortlessly by the author - - people whose lives are lived in stereotypical roles (Candidates for Governor, Political Staffers, Corporate Officer, Media and even Mafia) are not presented as stereotypes at all, but rather as real people. And all of the major players have entourages and those entourages are drawn so that the distinct characters within the groups emerge as clearly as the principal players in the drama.The plot is not something this reviewer wants to hint at, except to say that if one is only going to read one fast paced, complex, colorful novel this spring, this is the book to buy.This seemingly Louisiana story by a Louisiana writer is anything but a regional story. It's a big story that could play out anywhere. In setting the story in Louisiana, the writer did the reader a favor because he knows Louisiana as well as anyone who has set a story here.This should become a film. When one finishes reading the book, all one can hope for is the chance to see it on the big screen.
Summary 3: Pelican Games starts fast and keeps going. I was drawn into the plot immediately, then kept involved by the superb character development. In fact, the character development was good enough to make me actually despise one of the characters. I don't often get such a reaction to a novel character.The author was once a reporter and his eye for detail helps round out story line with very rich images.Several of the plot threads are ultimately resolved in ways that I didn't see coming. That was a nice change from the formula endings that seem to permeate novels.As a bonus, the chapters are short, making this a great bedside reader.
Summary 4: Ron Gomez has pulled off the unimaginable!!!Louisiana has long been infamous for its corrupt politicians and special interest dominated elections. Yet, no one has been able to accurately portray the totality of contemproary Louisiana politics in a single manuscript (fiction or non-fiction)until Ron Gomez penned Pelican Games. Pelican Games is an insightful, albeit fictional, account of the inner workings of ""play-for-keeps"" Louisiana gubernatorial politics. More importantly, the author has contrived a plot and created attendant characters that are guranteed to keep the reader spell bound and wanting more. The plot is indeed very plausible for Louisiana and never, ever predictable. This book can easily be charaterized as a fast-paced, ""thriller"" in every sense of the word. Yet, the author's clear writing and lucid descriptions allow time to literally stand still during the intense heat and fast pace of an all out ""battle-royale"" election for closest thing to a monarchy in America-the Lousiana Governorship. Gomez also goes to great lengths to explain the intricacies and oddities of Louisiana's political system.Written like a fine Dick Francis novel, Pelican Games provides the reader with a crystal clear expanse of the author's literary genius. Consequently, the reader does not have to possess a background in politics or, even like politics for that matter, to fully enjoy this book. Ron Gomez simply provides our wildest imagination for us! All we need do is show up and turn the pages."
1579590012,Creating Space: Essential Home Organization,"Summary 1: A few helpful hints among 160 pages of wasted space. Not a solution in the book. Nice pictures, but not practical for the family looking for storage and orgainzation ideas. Even the choice of font and layout make this one difficult to read. If you are looking for a practical home orgainization book (I was looking for a home office organization book), skip this one.
Summary 2: I was anticipating more forward thinking solutions to the home organization problem. I was not, however, disappointed with the photographs. Having recently purchased the Lighting Design Sourcebook by Wilhide, I knew, at the very least I would be getting some beautiful photos. The book is broken down into areas of the home (kid's rooms, living spaces...)and attacks each one separately offering &quot;stylish&quot; storage solutions. This book is clearly aimed at the homeowner looking to throw out the cardboard closet organizer and add a built-in, not the professional designer looking to supplement a design library with novel storage design resolutions.
Summary 3: This is one of the first books I read which suggested truly individualized ways for home owners, office planners, etc..to think about the way they used their space - rather than suggesting a cookie cutter approach to room and storage function. I really liked that approach.This point was driven home early in the book where one homeowner showcases a collection of lunchboxes - not something that just anyone would collect - and, obviously, requiring an innovative use of wall space to highlight them. In other, more traditional rooms, other storage ideas were suggested, along with floor plans to make the maximum use of space. There is a strong emphasis on form, function and aesthetics - in short, great ideas which also look good."
1589893026,Larry & Lilly Potter: More Than Just Friends,"Summary 1: I have all of N. K. Stoouffer's books and they are great for relating everyday things to your children or grandchildren. Also I know a friend with the name &#34;Larry Potter&#34; and he really got a kick out of a book with his name.
Summary 2: The book is so painfully simplistic, it looks as though it was made in one sitting. How could we possibly insult our children by making them think they're THIS ignorant?One child was swift to point out, ""Does Larry have a last name, too? Or is he sharing the last name of Lilly? As in 'Harry and Lily Potter' do?And I had no choice but to confirm that yes, there is indeed a reason why these books are so.. uh... disturbing. They're related. And happily dating.Btw, the first book, ""Larry Potter and his best friend Lilly..."" you can clearly see in the book cover that Lilly, for a best friend, is a little too snug on the ""personal space"" touching. Even Ron wouldn't be caught in that pose with Harry and they're REAL best friends! So does that cover count as a spoiler? Cause for some strange reason ""More than just friends"" was more of a joke than a surprise. .Glad it was borrowed and not bought.And grats on little Kathrine smart enough to figure out the mystery behind the nonsense! &lt;3
Summary 3: My cousin bought this book to read to his young sons. I decided to read it first before he did.At first I thought it was going to be all right. But as I started to read the story. I found that it was flat and not moving like you would have thought. Plus the title itself states sexual possiblities between Lilly and Larry Potter.Now don't get me wrong here, More than just friends is a term that most older adults would use for their 'sexual partners' who are not married to them. If I told my friend that I'm more than just friends with so and so person, the first thing that comes to their mind is oh she's having sex with him.I didn't read past the first three pages which is more than I did with the other books, I returned the book to my cousin and told him return it for a refund or an exchange of another book that is worth your time to read to your sons.Don't waste your money on this book it's not worth it.
Summary 4: I came down very hard on &quot;N.K.&quot; Stouffer's work in another review, so here I'll give her a small amount of credit. This isn't a great book, but for what it is -- a simple book aimed at very young readers -- it isn't bad. Young children might enjoy guessing what relation Larry and Lilly are to each other, and the book is actually a good deal better than the atrocious &quot;The Legend of Rah and the Muggles.&quot; I didn't love the illustrations, but children might not be so fussy.It probably goes without saying that Larry and Lilly Potter aren't wizards and bear no resemblance whatsoever to Harry and Lily Potter, but if you're looking for a fun book for a beginning reader this isn't a terrible choice. Stouffer should stick to writing for this market.
Summary 5: I looked through this book and found it to be very educational as far as various life lessons a child may need to learn. Really I do just want to point out that Larry Potter was copyrighted far before Harry Potter and that by saying it is a copycat is highly inaccurate and unfair. They are entirely different types of stories and styles and are aimed at entirely different audiences. So, if you are planning to buy this book for someone over the age of 5, they probably will not find it very entertaining. Otherwise, it's a great book for early readers."
0785273492,A Hero in Every Heart: Champions from All Walks of Life Share Powerful Messages to Inspire The Hero in Each of Us,"Summary 1: I thought that the book a hero in every heart was GREAT! I play alot of sports and when i was in doubt i would just open the book and read it until i felt better again. I think that everything in that book is absulotly true, i enjoyed it alot and i think that everyone athletic, or not should read this book, it is something to really get your self-eestem up if your in doubt! Overall I think this is a great book!
Summary 2: But when all things are considered the book is not really that bad, in fact certain quotes are very uplifting. I would rather read this then one of the 5 thousand Chicken Soup for the Souls any day of the week.
Summary 3: You can make a significant, positive difference! That's the message of this book. It is filled with quotable insights from a wide variety of sources. &quot;Great success demands great sacrifice&quot; we're told on page 16 and many of these contributors have paid their fair share. This book inspires one to give. We're reminded on page 21 that &quot;Ultimately we are remembered for what we give, not for what we take.&quot; In terms of cultivating the relationships in our lives, we're told &quot;The quality of your life is determined by the quality of the people in your life.&quot; There are so many good quotes throughout this whole book that it is a delight to go through and try to select a few to give a flavor of what one will find. Consider the quote on page 32, &quot;Everybody works hard when they feel like it, but only the best do it when they don't feel like it.&quot; In summary I'd just say &quot;buy it and read it.&quot; It's well worth the money and effort."
0879305940,No Static: A Guide to Creative Radio Programming,"Summary 1: This book should be course-required reading for those aspiring to a career in radio. As a student studying broadcast communications this book has been invaluable at framing the industry and providing insight into the nuances of the medium. Mr McCoy has been a pioneer in the industry and has consistently inspired creativity in others... this book continues that trend.
Summary 2: This books presents itself as a helpful guide to programmers, promoters, and everyday jocks for programming improvement. Surprisingly, the book was primarily based on author Quincy McCoy's own journey through the ranks in radio and his personal trials along the way. McCoy's story, albeit a testament of his talent, unfortunately lacks a great deal of content for those who are looking for a ""book of good radio ideas"". A better choice for today's programming staff, in more encyclopedic form and coming from another radio guru, isRadio: The Book, Fourth Editionby Steve Warren.
Summary 3: A great read with some helpful tips for neophytes. This book offers some ideas that would be beneficial to someone just starting or about to start a radio career. If you have a few years experience, this book will tell you little information that you haven't read in industry magazines. For those obsessed with radio it is still worth buying because it chronicles an amazing career.
Summary 4: If you want a book that will get your mind stirring, this is it."
1414301871,The Life of Jesus (Religion),"Summary 1: This retelling of the life of Jesus, is a simple, straightforward account. It would be very nice for a teenager or useful for a youth minister or a Sunday school teacher of teens and/or young adults.Bible Scholars and readers who enjoy more poetic language and more complexity would probably not enjoy this version; however, I don't think that's who it's intended for! :)I would recommend it for use by and instruction of younger readers and less experienced readers of the Bible.
Summary 2: While the stories here are in the bible, there's something about the presentation here that gripped me all the way through.
Summary 3: i could only read an hour of this poor paraphrase. ive read many paraphrases and this is one of the worst."
0873586883,"Gift For Abuelita / Un regalo para Abuelita: Celebrating the Day of the Dead/En celebracion del Dia de los Muertos (English, Multilingual and Spanish Edition)","Summary 1: This coming together of a writer's story &amp; the visions of an illustrator is perfect. A simple tale of sorrow, change, love &amp; healing. There are skills &amp; ideas tucked away inside this gift: of a child's grief over the death of her grandmother &amp; of the everyday things they did together &amp; how her people celebrate their loved ones memories with gifts &amp; prayers.A Gift for Abuelita/Un regalo para Abuelita is a treasure to be read again &amp; again not just for the story. It is rich in detailed illustrations &amp; the marriage of two languages telling the same story is a fine addition. For my full review do check out: [my website]
Summary 2: I purchased this book because of the outstanding, noteworthy illustrations and fell in love with the sensitivity of the text. I live in a community where the Day of the Dead is celebrated locally. I own several fiction and non-fiction books on the topic, which I use in my primary grade classroom. While other non-fiction children's books on the Day of the Dead do a better job of explaining what happens during this celebration, this is the only book I have found that explains on an emotional level why one would want to celebrate one's dead relatives.Although the relationship between Rosalita and her grandmother is established too quickly to cause the reader any distress when she dies on the third page of the text, Rosalita's dilemma is made clear. She works through the process of remembering and grieving her ""abuelita"" (grandmother). She thinks about what she can place on the family altar to symbolize her relationship with her deceased grandmother. She wonders what it will feel like when her grandmother's spirit returns on the Day of the Dead. How she resolves these questions will beautifully explain to anyone outside of the culture why those who celebrate this holiday take the time to remember.
Summary 3: This book is great for readers learning spanish or english. It has beautiful illustrations, and a great story that is based on an event that most children will have to face. The celebration of the day of the dead brings people closer to those who have passed away, and is a great idea to give to children.Este libro es muy bueno para lectores m&aacute;s jovenes para aprender ingl&eacute;s o espa&ntilde;ol. Tiene dibujos bonitas, y un gran cuento que es sobre un evento que muchos ni&ntilde;os tendr&aacute;n. La celebraci&oacute;n del Dia de los Muertos traiga los personas muy cercas a los personas que son muertos, y es una buena idea dar los ni&ntilde;os.
Summary 4: This book is a beautiful bilingual book that is ideal for young students. It serves as a nice introduction to Day of The Dead, which is celebrated in Mexico, on November 2. The author fails to mention this in the book but instead makes a note of it in the authors notes. Therefore,for clarity, the adult might want to incorporate this fact into the storyline. Use of another book, likeThe Day of the Dead / Dia De Los MuertosorMexican Day of the Deadas a supplement will enrich the students learning about Day of the Dead. The story is rather flat, as noted in one of the editorial reviews here but the salvation of the book are the rich illustrations. The artist when to great lengths to create dimension in the art, resulting in exquisite drawings that will captivate the young audience. The story evolves around young Rosita's loss of her mentor and grandmother to an undisclosed sickness. After she dies Rosita longs for abuelita(grandmother) and her grandfather(abuelito) and family teach Rosita how to honor the dead. They teach her about making abuelita's favorite goodies and making an offering to her spirit at home and at the graveyard. Rosita questions whether she will ""encounter"" abuelita or not but is eventually touched by her spirit. This is a very cool book that explains how grief for the departed is handled in Mexican culture. As stated the illustrations are magnificent and worth the price of the book alone. Bilingual students , or those learning a language, whose first language is either English or Spanish, will benefit from the text, if read to in both languages. Recommended for community and K-8 school libraries.
Summary 5: This book blends beautiful illustrations of artistic collages, with a touching story told from a young girl's perspective of losing her grandmother, and trying to find the perfect way to honor her beloved 'abuelita' on the Day of the Dead.Teaching at middle school in a community of growing numbers of hispanics this story has helped teach cultural traditions to my students in a unique way. In reading this story along with videos and personal sharing from our Mexican students and teachers, ALL our students celebrated the Day of the Dead this school year with their own artwork and special foods and breads. Having this story told in both English and Spanish was truly an added bonus for our English Language Learners to enjoy."
0141012404,Time Out Patagonia 1,"Summary 1: I have just returned from traveling five weeks through Patagonia and found myself using ""Time Out"" regularly for its engaging history, cultural and overall coverage.I started out in the Argentinean Lake District (Bariloche) and wove my way down to Tierra del Fuego (Ushuaia), crossing various times between Argentina and Chile. ""Time Out"" was my companion guide to both ""Footprint"" and ""Rough Guides"".No other guide gives you as much information regarding outdoor activies: Hiking, Golfing, Fishing, Hunting, Skiing; even Scuba Diving (you can dive the icy waters of Ushuaia!). The writing is engaging and erudite. For those that love nature no other guide gives you as much as this guide.HOWEVER, ""Time Out Patagonia"" should not be considered as your primary travel guide. It is more of a companion guide. It offers only a handful of restaurant and hotel recommendations, and often these recommendations are the most expensive. The small maps in this book are pathetic, and will help you locate nothing of significance.""Time Out Patagonia"" fills in the gaps that the other guides have. This is the guide you will read after the other guides have helped you with your accommodations and eateries (consider: Footprint Argentina 2006 - highly recommended - see my review). Strongly Recommended.
Summary 2: This book has an amazing amount of information on Patagonia in general, and specifically Valdes Peninsula where I will be visiting. I was going to spend a lot of money with tour packages, uncertain accommodations, and a guy waiting at the airport holding up my name on a poster board...but now I can arrange it myself with this book and a taxi.
Summary 3: It contains less information as it is thinner. It is organized more like documentary than guides, as you have your own transportation and go for trekking for days into the wildernss in both Chile and Argentina. It doesn't have the info of the popular tourist towns, accomdations and excursion operators. I bought also the Footprint and Rough Guide for the 40 days backpack trip mainly in Argentina in Dec 2007. They complementing each other and I personally like the Footprint. Email tenny52@yahoo.com if you want to know more about the trip.
Summary 4: Excellent guide for someone taking a trip to Patagonia. Precise in the level of information provided. It was used extensively during the 8 thousand mile trip by car. It helped in taking many decisions on sights and where to drive to and what to see."
0802009190,The Self and its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (Toronto Studies in Philosophy),"Summary 1: John Russon's ambitious aim in this book is twofold: (1) to identify the conception of the body that is implied by the argument of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, and (2) to provide a systematic argument that shows this conception of the body to be both comprehensive and compelling. Not only does the book make a good case for having succeeded in these aims, it also provides material for a very careful and provocative reinterpretation of Hegel's Phenomenology that should prove readable and insightful for both general readers with interests in the history of philosophy as well as trained philosophers.Russon shows that the body that animates the forms of experience that Hegel studies in his text cannot be adequately conceived as reducible to the merely physical organism. In an important early chapter, Russon gives an account of the systematic way in which Hegel's philosophy challenges and overcomes the dualism of immaterial mind and physical body that stands at the heart of early modern philosophy and science. He argues that the body as we experience it is not merely a natural entity (physis), but is a construct of habit and institutions; our experience of the body is not one merely of nature, but of second nature, as Aristotle described the habitual formation of social dispositions (hexis). The final chapters of the text aim to show, moreover, that this &quot;habit-body&quot; should be conceived ultimately as emerging through communicative activity (logos), and that the ongoing process whereby we (non-arbitrarily) constitute ourselves and our world along with others is precisely what is thematized in Hegel's dialectical phenomenology.Considering the difficulty of the topic, and the vast resources that the argument draws upon, the text is remarkably clear (and concise, at just 137 pages). You need not have spent several years poring over the details of Hegel's challenging and dense text in order to gain much benefit from reading Russon's book. In addition, the book has the merit of demonstrating (against a number of prejudices from a number of sources) that Hegel's philosophy can be a rich resource for thinking through a number of topics of contemporary concern. Russon's conclusions in fact converge nicely with recent efforts in a number of disciplines to draw attention to the embodied character of experience, cognition, and culture.
Summary 2: Russson's book is nothing less than a re-organization of the *Phenomenology of Spirit*, one that makes explicit the conceptual commitment to embodiment that may have been concealed from many readers. This re-organization is accomplished with an all-too-rare philosophical sophistication, as Russon draws on a variety of sources and informs his reading with a strong command of 20th century phenomenology.Among the book's strengths is a startlingly lucid and original reading of Hegel's text, a reading that illuminates many familiar passages and arguments in striking fashion. Russon's account of the master and slave, and his account of Sittlichkeit, re-animate texts often thought to have been exhaustively understood, revealing both the richness of Hegel's text and the power of a serious reader like Russon. But Russon is also adept at uncovering new insights in passages under-represented in the literature, and it is perhaps here that this book makes one of its strongest contributions. Russon on the reason chapter, and on the unhappy consciousness (the analysis of which is one of his central arguments), provides original and compelling arguments for the centrality of embodiment to the Hegelian understanding of self-consciousness.But arguably the most significant contribution made by this book is that it reminds us that a Hegelian argument can and should be a philosophical argument. Rather than limiting himself to contributing to ongoing debates within Hegel circles, Russon has engaged philosophical inquiry itself, and shown how Hegel's text, at the hands of a keen reader, can speak, indeed argue successfully, to the broader philosophical community. This book is an argument for the complete understanding of phases of embodiment as conditions of self-consciousness, and thereby an argument that brings phenomenology and Hegel into the centre of important contemporary discussions.
Summary 3: I highly recommend John Russon's _The Self and its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit_ to anyone with a philosophical interest in Hegel or the body: 1) It gives a compelling account of how Hegel would have to conceive body, and thus gives a new understanding of just what Hegel's phenomenology of spirit is concerned with, and what our bodies are. The latter is of central concern in much recent philosophy, and in everyday life in our political and technological culture. 2) It gives a lucid and convincing interpretation of Hegel's difficult book, one that proceeds through an engagement with historical positions in philosophy and science, and more important, through an engagement with the experience of trying to act responsibly in a situation, which experience haunts philosophy from the very beginning and is a most familiar element of life. Russon thus gets to the heart of Hegel's philosophy in a way that is illuminating for both the novice and the dedicated student of Hegel. And he thereby arrives at an important understanding of the body as that sphere of communicative and expressive existence which develops itself so as to enable responsible action in the first place. 3) The book's situation of Hegel in relation to ancient philosophy, transcendental argument and recent phenomenology invites a renewed engagement with Hegel, which is important given the role of Hegel in many current philosophical debates. In particular, Russon's discussion of the body and the unfolding of the Phenomenology of Spirit in terms of phusis (nature), hexis (habit) and logos (here meaning ""expression"") gives a very comprehensive and original way of grasping both the body and the Phenomenology. Likewise, his interpretation of Hegel's dialectic in terms of the relation of the empirical ego and transcendental ego and focus on recognition help clarify many crucial themes in Hegel. In general, Russon's elucidation of a concept of body in Hegel opens rich ways of thinking about our selves and our bodies."
158062698X,"Managing A Nonprofit: Write Winning Grant Proposals, Work With Boards, and Build a Successful Fundraising Program (Streetwise)","Summary 1: This book is a very good primer for getting one's feet wet in the world of non-profit organizations. While it is by no means exhaustive, it is certainly broad and deep enough for anyone to run their non-profit more efficiently and more ethically. It covers excellent project, team and board building strategies, as well as nearly every type of fundraising and solicitation. Additionally, there is good information on employing the internet for communication, engagement and fundraising -- STILL a fairly new field for many.Appendices A-C cover some very good tools and examples. Though the listed government grant sources in appendix D focus mainly upon the Humanities and the Arts, valuable web sources are given for finding grants in other areas.
Summary 2: This book covers a lot of topics relevant to operating a typical nonprofit organization. None of the topics are covered in much depth, but they are identified and discussed adquately. Just about all the topics covered are what a nonprofit Executive Director really should become expert in BEFORE she tries to found and run a nonprofit of her own. Unfortunately far too many nonprofit leaders try to become Executive Directors, Development Directors, or the like before they are ready. They probably haven't read this book when they should have.This book is split into 5 sections:I. Understanding nonprofit agencies (1-2)II. Guiding a nonprofit to success (3-6)III. Fundraising 101 (7-13)IV. Marketing, public relations, and the Internet (14-17)V. Appendices (18-21)And the five sections are split into 21 chapters:1. What is a nonprofit agency?2. Crafting a mission statement3. Building a nonprofit team4. Working with a board of directors5. Improving your day-to-day management skills6. Paperwork: corporate bylaws and financial statements7. Making fundraising your best friend8. Special events9. Corporate donations: learn the rules & reap the benefits10. Direct mail11. Understanding foundations and endowments12. Obtaining grants13. The Board's role in fundraising14. Why market your nonprofit?15. Using advertising16. Public relations17. Making the most of the Internet18. Nonprofit Board assessement tools19. Sample bylaws20. Sample grant proposal21. Government grantsThe real beauty of this book is that it identifies topics relevant to managing a nonprofit. After you read the cursory explanations for each, then I highly recommend you do some Google searching on the terms in order to find more in depth coverage. Treat this book like an outline for a research project on how to run a nonprofit and you will be really happy you got this book.I think the book would have been better if it had a chapter on Capital Campaigns and the feasibility studies necessary to have a good capital campaign. And I would have liked to see a chapter on major gift fundraising. And the book would have been more special if it had a resource chapter that listed great books on nonprofit management and fundraising. But none was included.I would have liked the book better if the section on fundraising had been organized a little differently. I think of fundraising as being about (1) annual campaigns, (2) grants, (3) special events, (4) major gift programs, (5) endowment campaigns, and (6) capital campaigns. Direct mail, advertising, public relations and the Internet all relate to annual campaigns. Those chapters probably should have been consolidated. Obtaining corporate donations and grants are close cousins. They probably should have been consolidated in a chapter entitled ""grants."" I'm going to rate this book high besides its shortcomings because it is still a pretty good book. 5 stars!
Summary 3: I really found a lot of very good info that anyone considering starting a non profit org can use.There are great sections on the exact steps to start fundraising, meet tax requirements, building an effective Board (really important)how to approach sponsors, holding a special event and a lot more.It is a pretty easy read. Even if you have done some of these tasks before I think you can adapt the suggestions and learn something new.I recommend this book."
0793514797,Polka Favorites: Accordion,"Summary 1: Kenny Kotwitz has done a excellent job on this music book. The arrangements are very good with alot of bass runs and fills etc. The arrangements are fairly diffucult so if you're a beginner you won't be able to play them right away. All of the songs are good enough to be played professionaly. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to play polkas. A very good book, well worth the money!
Summary 2: This is a great collection of polkas. The arrangements look great. If you're a beginner be warned, it doesn't have any fingering at all.
Summary 3: Have already got Waltz Favourites for the accordion so I knew what toexpect from this book. However, like the waltz music it's really good,easy to follow and I'm enjoying playing the many pieces and wouldrecommend it to anyone else. Many thanks
Summary 4: This book was fair...not as good as I expected though. The music was at an intermediate level but the arrangements could have been a lot better than they were. In general, I like the arrangements from Gary Dahl because they sound more musical. I am a professional accordion artist and in order to make these arrangements sound good enough to the point where I would feel comfortable performing them in public, I would basically have to re-arrange them myself...which defeats the purpose of buying a book of pre-arranged accordion songs."
096701770X,"Running with the Big Dogs: A Sled Dog Puppy Grows Up in Denali National Park, Alaska","Summary 1: I had the good fortune of growing up with Lori Yanuchi in a little place called Allentown, PA. What I didnt know back then was her talent for writing and zest for the outdoors! My hat goes off to Lori for capturing the hearts of young children and the young at heart with this great book &quot;Running with the Big Dogs&quot;! My boys were entertained and educated about Alaska and are waiting impatiently for her next book.....no pressure Lori! This book is not a dust collector!
Summary 2: This book is a good introduction to the annual Iditarod Sled Dog Race. The stories will inspire all ages to follow the race in March from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska. All readers will gain an appreciation of the dedication and determination of both musher and sled dog. These titles will be used in an elementary school setting.
Summary 3: Well. For not having many books for children on the subject, this book does fill a gap. But as a librarian, I wouldn't use this book in a storytime. The story alone is alright, but the voice of the dog is very juvenile-- more than necessary. It feels dumbed down for children. The rhyming scheme/rhythm is very inconsistent and a little distracting.The illustrations are corny and don't give any sense of urgency or weather. A story like this would be much better served by realistic interpretations. I understand communicating that the dogs want to run, but they are actually grinning in every single picture. I enjoy the formatting, with the gorgeous Frank Lloyd Wright-esque text boxes and the native flora and fauna on one page and the illustrations on the opposite.I'm glad the author is trying to write books about a subject she very clearly loves. She gives a brief intro to how the sled teams are still used and how they are raised. This book could benefit from a more non-fiction point of view and more resources listed for children interested in learning more.Also, to the reviewer who said it was a good book to get interested in the Iditarod, I have no idea how that could be. The Iditarod is not mentioned in the book, but rather how these sled teams are used to patrol for protection of wildlife."
087351517X,Swinging for the Fences: Black Baseball in Minnesota,"Summary 1: When one thinks of ""black"" baseball, an image of Jackie Robinson trying to break the Major League Baseball color barrier with the Dodgers comes to mind. About the last thing one would expect is to associate the lily-white state of Minnesota with black bseball, yet, in this intrigingly interesting book, Dr. Steve Hoffbeck shows how many other black baseball players suffered the same struggles as Jackie Robinson, their stories being told for the first time.Dr. Hoffbeck has assembled a team of 11 writers to tell the detailed story of black baseball players in Minnesota that begins in the late 19th century and ends with sad story of the fallen hero Kirby Puckett. This is not a book that revels in baseball statistics; rather, the writers focus on the players themselves: who they were, where they came from, the color barrier conflicts each had to face, and what happened to them after baseball. It is this personalized approach that grabs the mind of the reader, and makes this book so interesting.The book is divided into 24 concise chapters, each centered on a particular black baseball player or team. My favorite player chapters were as follows:1. Earl Batty and his attempt to bring racial equality to the southern ""plantation"" owner of the Minnesota Twins, Calvin Griffith.2. Satchel Paige's baseball barnstorming days in Minnesota. I am amazed with the pure pitching genius of 'Ol Satch, and how he was not allowed to compete against white major league baseball players until he was 42 years old in 1948. Even at that age (Paige being the oldest rookie to ever play major league baseball), Paige amazed the fans, his teammates, every batter he faced, and even the umpires with his amazing throwing skills. What a shame a man like Paige was denied his chance to excel at his first love while in his prime - just think of how the record books would look if Paige pitched 20-plus seasons in the major leagues!3. Toni Stone, the first black woman (or any woman of any color for that matter) to attempt to pitch at the major league level.4. The chapter on the tragic story of Kirby Puckett, the first black Minnesota baseball superstar, who had the fans of Minnesota in his back pocket, and then lost it all to allegations of spousal abuse and infidelity. Minnesota has never gotten over the fall of their hero Puckett and we lament to this day the sad ending to his stellar career.The above chapters are only my personal highlights of what has come together as an excellent book on black baseball. Other chapters deal with lesser known black players in Minnesota, yet, the themes of persistence through intense racial persecution and taunting, the shared black brotherhood of baseball, and the sacrifices these men went through to pursue their love of the game shine through.Hoffbeck and fellow writers have contributed a vital link to the previously untold ""missing"" history of black baseball.This book should be in the collection of anyone who loves the game of baseball, for it documents the early pioneers of black baseball, and shows the heavy financial and emotional price the players had to pay to seek their places in the game of baseball. Modern-day black baseball players owe a debt of gratitude to these early pioneers, for it was their superior abilities, pride, and persistence that finally brought down the long-standing nearly impregnable racial barrier of American baseball. Cudos to Hoffbeck and Company for telling their compelling stories.Jim Konedog Koenig
Summary 2: A great read for any Minnesota sports fan. Extremely interesting approach with a number of authors giving a lot of local information about small town teams and how black baseball players were accepted...or not accepted...in rural Minnesota. I found the articles dealing with the small towns much more interesting than the big city articles. I remember watching one of the games many years ago and found some new information that I did not know.
Summary 3: With the recent untimely passing of baseball hero Kirby Puckett, it's particularily worth noting that SWINGING FOR THE FENCES: BLACK BASEBALL IN MINNESOTA includes an oustanding chapter on the life of Puckett.The chapter on Puckett's life was penned by sportswriter and author Jay Weiner, who was the Twins beat writer for the Minneapolis Star Tribune during the 1980s. Weiner does a brilliant job in telling the ""rags-to-riches"" story of the offspring of the Chicago housing projects who became the smiling face of the Minnesota Twins.Weiner reveals the essence of Kirby Puckett, warts and all, and gives the reader a deeper sense of the tragic aura of Puck's career, injury, blindness, groping for posterity, and his induction into baseball's Hall of Fame.Perspective is needed on Puckett and his place in the baseball record in Minnesota and author Weiner does this in SWINGING FOR THE FENCES: BLACK BASEBALL IN MINNESOTA. The book gives TWINS fans a new level of understanding of baseball in Minnesota, tying the past to the present, to see how it all fits together in a lively style, rich in storylines, filled with pathos of the intertwining of the themes of manhood, fatherhood, and brotherhood. A great read for fans of Puckett and of the Minnesota Twins.
Summary 4: Twenty-three articles by a variety of authors, mostly college professors and journalists, cover the different facets of black baseball in Minnesota from its first days in the latter 1800s down to contemporary times. The general theme running through all of the diversified articles is the ""America Dream"" and the ""American Tragedy"" reflected in the histories of the teams and the careers and lives of individual players. The American Dream part of the theme deals with how playing baseball allowed players to strive for high personal achievement as well as enjoy various levels of economic security and social recognition. The American Tragedy part takes in not only the racism and discrimination players faced, but also personal troubles and disappointments of some of them. Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, and Willie Mays appear along with many relative unknowns. The exploits of teams named the Fergus Falls Musculars, the Quicksteps, and the Brown Stockings, among others, are related. The vibrant Minnesota black baseball scene going back well over a century is treated in a popular style profiling great and other notable players and following the courses, and occasional dramatic moments, of the teams.
Summary 5: ""Swinging For The Fences,"" is a fascinating journey through Minnesota african american baseball history from the late 19th century to the present day. The book focuses on themes such as race, manhood, brotherhood, and fatherhood, and traces the struggles and triumphs of several black ball players who lived and played in Minnesota.Through the stories of remarkable athletes such as Bud Fowler, Satchel Paige, Willie Mays, Dave Winfield, and Kirby Puckett, the authors trace the vivid, if not well known,saga of black baseball in the upper midwest , from the town team days right up to the arrival of the Twins and beyond.Unlike many baseball histories, ""Swinging For The Fences,"" doesn't overwhelm you with mind numbing facts and figures and a real love for the game shines through. The book also contains many never before published photos. Painstakingly researched and beautifully written, ""Swinging For The Fences,"" is as exhilarating and fulfilling as a ninth inning rally !-Todd Peterson, Member, The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)"
0882894331,Rhythm and Blues In New Orleans,"Summary 1: This book is the original and still definitive book on New Orleans rhythm &amp; blues, the music that was the true forerunner of what popularly became rock 'n' roll. As a boy in England, Broven was so thrilled by Little Richard's performance of the song &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; in the movie DON'T KNOCK THE ROCK that he ran from the matinee showing at his local theatre to buy it before the record store closed. It was only years later that he discovered that Little Richard's hits, like those of his other favorite, Fats Domino (who dominated Louisiana music and rhythm &amp; blues in the 1950s and is appropriately pictured on the cover) were recorded by New Orleans studio musicians who created the backbone of rockin' rhythm &amp; blues. Other musicians featured here include Roy Brown, who popularized the word &quot;rock&quot; in rhythm &amp; blues long before Alan Freed in his 1947 classic &quot;Good Rockin' Tonight&quot; (which like Little Richard and other New Orleans records were significantly covered by Elvis Presley); Aaron Neville, Dave Bartholomew, Lloyd Price, Allen Toussaint and legendary drummer Earl Palmer, the last four of whom have recently been inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Similarly to Charlie Gillett's groundbreaking classic THE SOUND OF THE CITY, Broven thoroughly covers the record companies who came to New Orleans to mine the city's musical gold, but he also takes an in-depth look into the musicians which made the city a musical force. RHYTHM &amp; BLUES IN NEW ORLEANS features interviews with many of them, including Mac &quot;Dr. John&quot; Rebennack, whose lengthy reminisces during an English tour inspired the book. It is a must for anyone interested in the history of rhythm &amp; blues, rock 'n' roll, black culture or New Orleans culture.
Summary 2: I think I have read this book at least 5 times. It easy to read and includes info about all the stars of New Orleans Rock and Roll.
Summary 3: The New Orlean's Rhythm and Blues scene is amazing. Its history is breathtaking and revealing. Learning about how greats like Professor Longhair and Dr. John developed, and learned from one another has helped me develop as a pianist.
Summary 4: I was so impressed with the first 15 or 20 pages of this book after purchasing it in a thrift store a couple of years ago. While gigging with a band in Florida , I carelessly left it in a motel room and it was never returned to me. Now I am looking for another copy,so I can finish reading it and add it to my personal book collection."
0880010487,History of My Heart (American Poetry Series),"Summary 1: Want to check out some poetry that won't blind you with its self-importance? Give Pinksy a whirl. He wasn't poet laureate for nothing, and this volume shows why: his work is everyday-ish, regular images told in regular language, but stacked in such a way that the power of the images play movies in your head with every turn of the page. The book gets off to a ripping start and calms down from there, but is no less compelling.Like really good, quiet fireplace conversation.
Summary 2: Reading this is reading a master at work. Pinsky wields so much skill it's ridiculous. Reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent, old man sitting in a chair somewhere in a field, giving his thoughts free rein, following them where they land. In my opinion, the poem ""The Figured Wheel"" is a lyrical, breath-taking masterpiece.
Summary 3: Pinsky is in love with being a poet, but his poems don't mean anything to the rest of us. This book is a perfect example of this. We are supposed to admire him, not read him, and I find it a shame that this lousy work got him a Luareateship."
081302627X,Sputnik and the Soviet Space Challenge,"Summary 1: Asif Siddiqi covers the first laps of the space race from the Soviet side. This tome goes deeper than just the hardware by covering some of the personalities involved on the Soviet side of the space industry. If you are interested in the history of early space exploration, this book fills in many of the holes that most Western histories leave unexplored.
Summary 2: Great book, which describes the development the entire Soviet space program, its virtues and flaws!A great book for those who want to know more background on this issue,and a true story of what happened behind the ""iron curtain""! Apology politics aside, but simply a chronic and very interesting history of this nation!
Summary 3: A book where every name ,situation,person is based in facts and books.A book where author knows his sources and have a clear view of achivments and drawbacks of Soviet space programmAn author who can read Ruusian and have of net contact of the sourcesI found the style of language difficult but fluid.
Summary 4: This book covers the soviet space/rocket program from it's infancy (before and following WWII) all the way to Kolarov's death. It does so in what I would call, pure history book style, or 'just the facts please'. I did find it to be VERY informative after reading for years on the US space program to hear how the soviet program was actually done was a real eye opener for sure and it will keep you going for that next page/chapter in that respect. What it was lacking though was the story side. I had expected more on the missions themselves, more on the events that had occurred during the missions, how they were solved, etc. 95% of the book covers the developement of the vehicles and the in-fighting of the soviet space program and it's personalities, not very much on the actual development and any issues that would arise during. It was the ICBM program that kept the soviet space program alive during these times and much of the book is devoted to this. I was expecting more a book on the soviet space program, it's missions, and the people involved including more on the cosmonauts and the race with the US.If you are looking for an easier, more back-story type read on the soviet space program, this is not for you. If you are heavily into the space program and it's total history, this will definitely fit the bill there."
0452007569,The Titan (Meridian classics),"Summary 1: Dreiser's second novel of a three book series, the first being The Financier, continues the saga of Frank Cowperwood's quest for power and wealth through the use of financial acumen found in only a relatively few individuals. While written as fiction, the novel is also a wonderful history lesson of the political structure and shenanigans employed by the political and financial mavens of that period. The characters and events of the late 19th century are brought to life through Dreiser's rich and descriptive prose. Relatively few authors are able to attain the degree of detail Dreiser devotes to his plot and characters, all the while employing word usage in such as a way as to create a virtual masterpiece.
Summary 2: This book is a must read for any investor. It makes clear that economic bubbles and financial crises have the same causes in all centuries: excessive debt, secured by speculative assets. Once the collateral falls in price, the lender requires to repay the debt or add more collateral. Since the borrower have used excessive leverage, he is unable to handle the debt and goes bankrupt, which leaves the lender with illiquid assets. Here are some examples:1871: Frank Cowperwood have used stocks of Philadelphia's railroads as a collateral to huge loans, and when the Great Chicago Fire sparked a financial panic, he could neither repay the debt nor add more collateral, thus became insolvent.1929: Widespread use of margin, of up to 90% was one of the reasons of the Great Depression. The investor could buy $100,000 worth of stock with $10,000 of own cash, borrowing the remaining $90,000 from the broker. The sharp drop of the stock price made the investors unable repay the debt, they became insolvent. The brokers were left with cheap stocks and became insolvent also.2007: The dot-com bubble of 2000 contributed to the housing bubble. Once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed. The families were buying houses when they knew that they cannot afford the mortgage for a long time, they were buying only to sell it to later at higher price. The rise in home prices was very attractive for construction industry: the number of newly built houses have significantly increased. When the prices of the houses have fallen due to the balance between the supply and demand, the speculators who run out of cash to repay the mortgages could no longer sell the houses at a price they bought. This essentially led homeowners to foreclosures. The great amount of foreclosures have caused huge losses to the lenders, made them insolvent or put under Government's conservatorship, when the shareholder value was diluted if not wiped out.While the first book in the trilogy, ""The Financier"", is not a skilled picture of smallest traits of a human soul when it comes to love and feelings, this second book, ""The Stoic"", covers the human soul better, but not as good as in writings by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky (take ""The Brothers Karamazov""). When it comes to the financial aspects, they are very well covered. I recommend you to read the whole trilogy: ""The Financier"", ""The Titan"" and ""The Stoic"".
Summary 3: The Titan is an excellent sequel that, unlike many sequels, does not require the reader to have read its prequel, The Financier. Frank Cowperwood is a still-waters-run-deep kind of central character. Our story begins with his release from prison for racketeering, his descent onto Chicago with new bride-to-be, Aileen, and a stoic determination brewing behind those blue-gray eyes that, ""somebody is gonna pay for this."" That somebody is first the gas companies and then the newly emerging ""Elevated"" light rail lines of Chicago, which he proceeds to take over. Cowperwood is an immoral man. He cheats compulsively on his wife, pays off the city council and mayor to get franchise awards, and even contrives to bribe and blackmail the Illnois governor. This is not a character we are supposed to admire, in fact few of the characters we meet--Aileen, Mrs. Carter, Hosmer Hand, or Berenice Fleming--are heroic characters in the swashbuckling sense. But Dreiser warns us that human frailties are not without struggle, that lack of conscience does not always make it easy to inflict one's will and evil-doing on others, and that, most of all, in high society, money has its limits (at least in 1914). Be prepared to have a dictionary handy when reading Titan, many words that have long fallen out of favor are used extensively, including, ""peregrination,"" ""trig,"" ""fag,"" ""ermine,"" ""bacchanal"" and ""phatasmagoria."" Titan is a terrific read that draws on the history of Chicago as a burgeoning megalopolis.
Summary 4: Theodore Drieser's _The Titan_ (1914), book two in the author's trilogy of the uber-American businessman, describes the ""come back"" of the unscrupulous yet charming financier Frank Algernon Cowperwood. _The Financier_ (1911), the first book in the series, ends with Frank Cowperwood being convicted of financial conspiracy and bribery of public officials in Philadelphia. _The Titan_ picks up with the second phase of Cowperwood's financial life. Having completed his prison sentence, Cowperwood, now in his early thirties, walks into the daylight from the Eastern District Penitentiary walls in Philadelphia with the realization that he is no longer a young man and that he must begin his life anew.The early chapters chronicle Cowperwood's journey to Chicago and his efforts to establish a new life in a society with Aileen Butler, his mistress who becomes his second wife after he secures a divorce. With a longing to ""test whether the world would trample him under foot or not,"" Cowperwood undertakes a long, complicated journey to emerge on top, not only of the financial world of Chicago in the 1880s but of the United States as a whole. Constitutionally, Cowperwood is, in a large measure, fit for the challenge.First, we see Cowperwood's acumen in financial matters as he acquires a small Chicago gas company, which over time challenges for a controlling interest in public gas in Chicago. He then purchases a streetcar line in north Chicago, threatening the entrenched business oligarchs of Chicago. Suborning public officials and always finding the right people to undertake his schemes--throughout much of the book Cowperwood uses proxies to advance his business aims and remains behind the scenes--he becomes a scandalously powerful mogul. At the same time, his private affairs descend into chaos. Numerous reckless extra-marital affairs undermine his business partnerships with Chicago's elite, making former friends into deadly adversaries. The intrigues and deceptions of a Cowperwood's public and private lives are put under the microscope in hundreds of detailed pages.Early in the novel Cowperwood seduces Rita Sohlberg, a woman married to a failed violinist, and from this relationship a pattern emerges. In urging his suit, Cowperwood argues, ""Life is between individuals, Rita. You and I have very much in common. Don't you see that?"" He adds, ""There is so much that would complete your perfectness."" The first of many affairs, Cowperwood's relationship with Rita is supported by a view of the world where the individual's needs reign supreme. The public and private identities of Cowperwood merge within this credo: one's obligation is to satisfying oneself alone.Throughout the novel, Drieser himself, like many of the secondary characters in _The Titan_ is seduced by Cowperwood's persona and prone to forgive his faults. In the final paragraphs, the narrator attempts to explain the meaning of Cowperwood's life and his magnetism as a fulfillment of a certain personality type: ""Each according to his temperament,"" concludes the novel.Cowperwood shares traits with larger-than-life living figures in the business world like Donald Trump, who capture the public imagination. Frank Cowperwood is the predescessor of a number of fictional businessmen, including Charles Foster Kane (from Orson Wells' _Citizen Kane_) or Gordon Gecko (from _Wall Street_). Cowperwood embodies the mystique of the robber barrens and tycoons of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-centuries who amassed huge fortunes, and who were both loved and hated by the public for their magnificent spoils and audacious ill-gotten gains.
Summary 5: Theodore Dreiser clearly was a great writer at the beginning of the 20th Century. He, along with few others, dared challenge conventional writing styles and TD did it quite boldly. Critics have long argued about the merits of his writings - it is for the reader to decide. He is certainly heavy and dense but he had arguments he wanted to make and, rest assured, he made them with a sledgehammer.The Titan has the same central theme as The Financier with our Mr. Cowperwood out to conquer the world of business and of women of society. The destruction brought to all is readily apparent but the realism brough to the reader, along with a wonderfully unique style of writing is worth the efforts of his works.I rated this one star lower than The Financier but think whichever is read first is going to be the one the reader prefers. Perhaps his themes wear on one and the second time around (with a third waiting to be read, The Genius)his premise and social and economic criticisms become a bit redundant. That said, if you like one, you are going to like the other. Also, it is great to see nascent protestations of a growing industrial economy and the obvious implications in today's corporate world."
0292706294,Cooking with Texas Highways,"Summary 1: I just bought this. And read it. I have hundreds of cookbooks, and 2 shelves of Texas ones. Not only is it the best Texas cookbook, it has become my instant favorite cookbook, and gets my vote for the best cookbook in the world! No kidding! Why?This is a beautifully illustrated book, with ALL of your Texas favorites- from Tex-Mex to Czek. And nice reading on some of our local favorite producers- for example of goat cheese.I have grown completely sick of 'chef' cookbooks. Not only are we supposed to cook like a trained professional would in a resturaunt these days, we are supposed to cook for celebrities- or so it would seem from the endless celebrity chef cookbooks out there. This is a 'real' cookbook. For real people- and it is authentic. The cookbook I read just before this one, while really very good, had loads of bell peppers in the fajitas! I mean- yikes! This book is brave enought to list the famous (and much loved) but really tacky (and chefs would cringe) Texas classics- such as Rotel Cheese Dip and Frito Pie. There are of course much more sophisticated recipes, but all look wonderful.Lastly, any book with such a drop-dead beautiful photo of bluebonnets gets my vote. But then I have never seen an ugly copy of a Texas Highway Magazine either.
Summary 2: I chose this book as a gift for a non-Texan, and then had to purchase another for myself! I love the variety of recipes in the book, which include traditional Texas favorites, recipes representing the numerous ethnic populations in Texas, as well as more current Texas food trends. The book is full of beautiful color photos, historical facts and trivia relating to the recipes. Well worth the money spent.
Summary 3: I already had this cookbook in my collection and bought this one for a gift for a good friend. Great"
087123260X,How to Answer a Mormon,"Summary 1: What an entertaining read...complete fiction I must add but a good book to remind you that there are still narrow minded people in the world who profess to know so much about a religon that they actualyy know very little about.

Summary 4: Anyone who has the ability to think for himself or herself certainly does not need this book. Or are you afraid of having your beliefs challenged?
Summary 5: One Protestant leader in a lecture compared Robert A. Morey to that of Walter Martin. I would agree, from a comparison of this title with Martin's KINGDOM OF THE CULTS. Both are suprisingly lacking of scholarship, though this is far worse. Martin is today a joke among LDS scholars at BYU (esp. FARMS), and this book would fare much better. It is an egregious title, quite simply.I come onto the Protestant Evangelist VS. Latter-day Saint debate with little bias, for I am wouldn't call myself either at the present time. For the Protestants (in their unusual epistemology) start witht he position to prove Mormonism wrong and &quot;help&quot; them, before analysing the LDS church on a factual level, this book will be a blessing. The problem? I feel that though this book has the ring of truth it is in turn specious.When I purchased and glazed through this book, I came to the rather obvious inference that this book was whipped together rather quickly. In earlier times my friends and I used to humorously joke that we whipped homework together &quot;on the bus on the way to school,&quot; I would say Morey did just that (in a symbolic manor) -- this book doesn't have the thorough scholarship that is needed to tackle the 'big leagues' of LDS scholarship and apologetics in FARMS, FAIR, even SHIELDS. The essay by two extremely bright indivuals titled &quot;Mormon Scholarship and Evangelical Neglect&quot; which is a detailed analysis of the current lack of ANY scholarship to respond to LDS is a valid cause for concern which this book does not fill.The book is divided into two sections. Part 1 is a &quot;how to use this book&quot; which gives a brief discription of the LDS church from an Evangelical perspective, and then continues to give nine &quot;documented&quot; false prophecies. A found a number of statements in Part 1 to be unusual and noteworthy. First, he states that Mormons are &quot;disciples of Joseph Smith&quot; (pg. 12). In all my studies of LDS doctrine, history, and culture, I have yet to read a LDS refer to him/herself as a &quot;disciple of Joseph Smith.&quot; (Though they do refer to themselves as disciples of Jesus quite often).Morey then continues (ibid.) to give tell us &quot;A Christian needs to understand what a 'cult' is.&quot; His definition is what I refer to as the &quot;Protestant&quot; one, as there is no set in stone definition of cult and a Mormon could easily turn around and make a definition that makes Protestants to be &quot;cultists&quot; and in a &quot;cult&quot; while LDS are excluded from this definition. Mormonism has many similarities to the early church: is the early church a cult? Morey basically argues that any church that doesn't view the Bible as #1 authority, 100% is a cult, yet the early church didn't even have a Bible -- not some three hundred years after Christ where the century long debate concerning book authority was finally clamped down upon. I have a hard time believing the canon is the work of God or closed.Morey then continues and tells us that a Christian &quot;must understand that Mormonism is a cult.&quot; Circular reasoning--yes. He then states that Mormonism is &quot;built entirely upon Joseph Smith&quot; -- this statement is ENTIRELY not true. Mormonism is based upon the standard works (KJV, BOM, D&amp;C, PGP), past and present general authorities. It would be like me turning back at Morey and saying that &quot;Protestantism is built entirely upon Paul of Tarsus.&quot;Morey's first false prophecy (hereby FP) is concerning Jesus' return and Joseph Smith's teachings concerning it. The 1891 issue is clearly a conditional prophecy (hmmm...similar to Jonah's escapades), while other's concern Jesus coming &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;not many days hence&quot;, etc. etc. We must recall that the NT speaks of Jesus coming back &quot;soon&quot; and even before everyone from that generation dies. While scholars such as Witherington and Sproul have done detailed examinations of eschatology, Morey's comparisons are hypocritical.FP#2 concerns the 12 tribes of Israel. I admit to having never studied that and its relation to Mormonism, so I would examine his criticisms in that area. Next though, is his &quot;moon man&quot; FP criticism. Morey's analysis is horrible. His only first person (or Hyrum, Joseph Smith's brother) quotations come from a source dated around 40 years after Joseph Smith's death.Morey's arguments about the LDS trip to Salem are not given a time-limit and can yet occur. For the others I have yet to discuss, I again admit to ignorance concerning them. Though all of the alleged false prophecies of Joseph Smith seem to me to have about all the substance of most of the alleged contradictions of the Bible and false prophecies of the Bible.Morey concludes by writing &quot;what should evey Mormon know&quot; (pg. 117) where he quotes some biblical passages. I found his statement that we cannot be saved by baptism to be odd. It seems many Protestants believe in &quot;decisionism&quot; -- that one must make the sinners prayer (or similar) and/or they are saved at a specific moment which is much similar to the LDS view of baptism. It's not a work, it is what initiates grace though (as clearly something has to, and Protestants typically believe it is the sinner's prayer).Oddly, Morey writes there is a &quot;heaven to gain and a hell to shun&quot; as one of his finishing statements. LDS accept this and argue (to some extent successfully) that the Bible could and possibly does refer to three levels of heaven upon which we will reside. He concludes by writing that Jesus is the only name we can come to to be saved (and that Joseph Smith can't save us). Who said Mormons believed that Joseph Smith cleansed their sin? Any Mormons perhaps (this excludes some alleged statements in JoD by Brigham Young which we are at best unable to be sure were an accurate recording).I found this book to be bad, and another needless book among the 2000 other &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; books that have been (or still are) in publication. Sadly, I can recommend no good scholarly criticisms of Mormonism: there are none that i know of. I recommend a good, thorough analysis of Mormon doctrine, church, culture, history and then come to a full conclusion. Not some cheap shots from the hip from (Bob Morey), a man who is not an expert in the field.
Summary 6: Robert Morey (born 1946) is a Christian apologist and pastor who has written a number of books and pamphlets, such asHow to Answer a Jehovah's Witness,Islamic Invasion,Death and the Afterlife,The Truth About Masons,Reincarnation and Christianity, etc.Morey gives a short introductory chapter to this 1983 book, but the bulk of it consists of photocopies of documentation from LDS sources of Morey's points. He explains in the first chapter, ""Part 2 of this book contains the documentation for some of the false prophecies of Joseph Smith. Although there are over sixty obviously false prophecies made by Joseph Smith, the ones which are included in Part 2 are the most useful.""Here are some quotations from the book:""The only issue which the Mormons are not well-prepared to discuss, with any measure of knowledge, is the issue of Joseph Smith's claim to be a true prophet of God. Although these missionaries have memorized their 'missionary handbook' and have practiced their presentation and arguments, they are not ready to deal with this issue because is it not dealt with in their manual."" (Pg. 14)""(Joseph Smith's) claims are so astounding that there are only three logical positions one can take concerning the prophetic claims of Joseph Smith. First, we can believe that Smith was whom he claimed to be---God's latter-day prophet... Second, we can believe that Smith was a fraud and that he knowingly sought to deceive people in order to obtain their possessions and control their lives. If Smith was a fraud and a liar, then he should be exposed... Third, we can believe that Smith was insane and that he had delusions of grandeur in which he thought he was a 'prophet of God.' In this light, he would be an object of pity..."" (Pg. 24)""We have examined the historical and factual evidence which documents eight false prophecies of Joseph Smith. According to Deuteronomy 18:20-22, just one false prophecy is sufficient to identify a false prophet... these eight prophecies are sufficient to demonstrate beyond all reasonable doubt that Joseph Smith was NOT a prophet of God.""

Summary 3: Hi , I bought this book with the expectation to be a guide to in practice how to being dressed in the finest classical style. This is a good guide, however to be aware of the theory of classical style. It is a good book, with history of each piece of cloth, patterns and so on. But you'll have to read it and figure out the best dressing by your own. I would like to have some more tips on how to match and it could have a lot more of pictures.I recommend for anyone that want to know the varieties and the history behind the gentleman dressing style"
B0007ESV6Y,Selected poems (The Pocket poets series),"Summary 1: Fine as an introduction to Duncan, but not for serious study. At best, this is a ""Greatest Hits"" record--though that said, it's a bit like buying Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. It's good in that it touches every portion of his career, but since Duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of ""the book of poetry,"" ultimately it leaves the reader wanting.
Summary 2: While a bit disappointing and limited (as all ""Selected Poems"" will be), this volume succeeds as an introduction to Robert Duncan's impressive body of work. Particularly of interest are the excerpts from early volumes (pre- ""The Opening of the Field"" and presumably out of print) which evidence Duncan's evolution. Along with Jack Spicer and Robin Blaser, Robert Duncan revolutionized American poetry during the Berkeley renaissance; their triumvirate of influence, more so than any combination of Beat writers, defined homosexual poetics in the twentieth century. The addition of Kenneth Rexroth and Weldon Kees to the list of great Californian poets of that period makes a good case for it being the most underrated generation of American poets. Sadly, unlike the other four, Duncan has never had a ""Collected Poems"" assembled for him. Let's hope that someday soon, that will be rectified.
Summary 3: ""How will we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?"" cries the Psalmist. Robert Duncan was an orphan, a modernist and lyticist. With HD and her contemporaries, he sang in a deep and devout voice from the American wilderness.No ""selected"" collection does any poet justice, and Duncan is best read complete. But this volume contains favorites and is large enough to cover both the holy and secular grounds that Duncan mapped.As always, read inwardly and aloud. You will find wonder and treasure here.
Summary 4: I am much satisfied with the book and its dealer's rapid service. I would like them to send a receipt as soon as possible."
